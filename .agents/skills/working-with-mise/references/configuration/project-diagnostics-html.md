Project diagnostics

Project diagnostics [​](#project-diagnostics)

`mise doctor project` runs named checks from your project's configuration and reports every result. Use it to check requirements that tool versions alone cannot establish, such as whether a compiler can discover a native library or whether a database accepts connections.

toml

```
[doctor.checks.openssl]
description = "OpenSSL development files are discoverable"
run = "pkg-config --exists openssl"
hint = "Run `mise bootstrap packages apply` to install the declared build dependencies."
timeout = "5s"
os = ["linux", "macos"]

[doctor.checks.database]
description = "PostgreSQL accepts connections"
run = "pg_isready --quiet"
hint = "Start the project's services with pitchfork."
timeout = "5s"
```

sh

```
mise doctor project
mise doctor project --json
```

Example output:

text

```
PASS database: PostgreSQL accepts connections
FAIL openssl: OpenSSL development files are discoverable
  Command exited with exit status: 1
  Run `mise bootstrap packages apply` to install the declared build dependencies.
```

Ordinary `mise doctor` continues to diagnose mise itself; it does not run these checks. Checks do not run automatically when entering a directory or running a task. There are no implicit project checks: declare the requirements you need.

## Check configuration [​](#check-configuration)

Each `[doctor.checks.<name>]` table supports:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `run` | Required shell command; exit zero to pass. |
| `description` | Human-readable requirement. Defaults to the check name in text output. |
| `hint` | Guidance shown after a failure or execution error. Never executed. |
| `timeout` | Positive duration such as `500ms` or `5s`; defaults to `10s`. |
| `dir` | Working directory. Relative paths resolve from the declaring configuration's root; `~/` and absolute paths are used as given. Defaults to that root. |
| `shell` | Executable and arguments, including the command flag, such as `"bash -c"` or `"pwsh -Command"`. Defaults to mise's inline task shell. |
| `os` | OS or OS/arch selector, or a nonempty list, such as `"linux/arm64"` or `["linux", "darwin"]`. Omit to run everywhere. |

Checks use the active configuration hierarchy, including environment-specific configuration. A higher-precedence definition replaces the entire check of the same name, including its hint and working directory. Checks run concurrently, bounded by the `jobs` setting (`MISE_JOBS`), so slow probes can share their waiting time. Results remain in name order and a failed check does not stop other checks. Set `jobs = 1` for sequential execution.

Commands receive the project's environment and installed tool paths, including environment removals. Diagnostics do not install tools or run task dependencies or task hooks. Environment directives still evaluate normally, so author checks as inspection commands and use normal mise configuration trust. Project checks that apply to the current platform report errors in safe mode. Empty or entirely platform-excluded check lists still succeed. Checks are not sandboxed.

Each command has a deadline and a combined 64 KiB stdout/stderr limit. Timeouts and output-limit failures terminate the owned process tree. Command output is captured and discarded rather than included in reports, so a probe cannot accidentally print a credential into the report. Use `description` and `hint` to explain the requirement and remedy; run the command directly for its detailed output.

Absolute paths, a leading `~/`, and `..` components in `dir` are allowed, as with task working directories; templates are not rendered. The configuration root anchors relative paths; it is not a filesystem boundary. Checks can intentionally inspect a sibling checkout or shared local service directory. Checks declared in global or system configuration use the invocation directory as their root, like tasks; a `mise.toml` directly in the home directory is project configuration and anchors at the home directory. Shell overrides use task quoting conventions and honor `windows_powershell_no_profile`. The OS selector accepts the same aliases (`darwin`, `win`, `amd64`, and others) as tool filters; `os = []` is rejected. Unknown `[doctor]` container options are ignored for forward compatibility (the JSON schema allows them too), while unknown check fields are rejected to catch typos.

On Unix, Ctrl-C, SIGTERM, and SIGHUP cancel running checks and close their owned process groups, including when doctor runs inside a mise task. A signal the parent ignored, such as SIGHUP under `nohup`, stays ignored. As with any cleanup that requires the supervisor to run, SIGKILL prevents cleanup; stop doctor with SIGTERM before escalating to SIGKILL.

## Results and automation [​](#results-and-automation)

The JSON report contains `checks` and `errors` arrays. Top-level `errors` contains configuration loading errors; in that case `checks` is empty. Otherwise `errors` is empty and each declared check has a result in `checks`. Each entry contains `name`, `description`, `source` (the declaring configuration file), `status`, `message`, and `hint`. Optional fields are `null` when absent.

- `pass`: the command exited successfully.
- `fail`: the command exited unsuccessfully.
- `error`: mise could not execute or finish the check, including a timeout, invalid check options, or an unavailable project environment.
- `skipped`: the check's `os` selection excludes the current system.

A shell can report a missing command as a nonzero exit; that is a `fail`, while failure to launch the shell itself is an `error`.

The command exits with status 1 if any check fails or cannot be completed. An empty check list or only skipped checks exits successfully. Configuration loading failures, including required environment values that prevent loading, are reported in the top-level `errors` array. If configuration loads but preparing the tool environment fails, affected checks each report an error and platform-excluded checks remain skipped.

This is a compatibility check of the current machine. Passing does not establish whole-environment reproducibility. Keep tool and application lockfiles for the parts of your environment they cover.
