mise run

run` [​](#mise-run)

- **Usage:** `mise run [FLAGS] [TASK] [ARGS]…`
- **Aliases:** `r`
- **Source code:** [`src/cli/run.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/cli/run.rs)

Run tasks and their dependencies

Use `mise run TASK [ARGS...]` for one task, or separate task invocations with `:::` to schedule several. Put mise flags before the task name; following arguments are passed to that task. With no task, mise runs `default` when defined or opens the task selector in an interactive terminal.

Tasks are defined in `mise.toml` or task directories. A task with `sources` and `outputs` can skip execution when its outputs are fresh. `--force` bypasses freshness checks; task output caching has separate `--task-cache` controls.

For a project that already has npm build scripts and its dependencies installed:

toml

```
[tasks.build]
run = "npm run build"
sources = ["src/**/*.ts", "package.json", "package-lock.json"]
outputs = ["dist/**/*.js"]
```

To create a standalone script task, use `mise tasks add --file hello -- echo hello`. Then run `mise run hello`. See <https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/> for task directories, arguments, caching, and dependency configuration.

## Flags [​](#flags)

- **`--affected`** — Run matching tasks only for projects affected by Git changes
- **`--affected-base <REV>`** — Git base revision for --affected Defaults to MISE\_AFFECTED\_BASE, CI metadata, or HEAD\~1
- **`--affected-explain`** — Explain why projects and tasks were selected by --affected
- **`--affected-head <REV>`** — Git head revision for --affected Defaults to MISE\_AFFECTED\_HEAD, CI metadata, or HEAD
- **`--affected-json`** — Output affected projects and tasks as JSON without running tasks
- **`--all`** — Open the interactive selector with all tasks from the entire monorepo
- **`-c --continue-on-error`** — Continue running tasks even if one fails
- **`-C --cd <CD>`** — Change to this directory before executing the command
- **`-f --force`** — Force the tasks to run even if outputs are up to date
- **`-j --jobs <JOBS>`** — Number of tasks to run in parallel Values below 1 are treated as 1 Defaults to the `jobs` setting or the `MISE_JOBS` env var

  **Environment Variable:** `MISE_JOBS`
- **`-n --dry-run`** — Don't actually run the task(s), just print them in order of execution
- **`-o --output <OUTPUT>`** — How task output is displayed
  - `prefix` - Print stdout/stderr by line, prefixed with the task's label
  - `interleave` - Print directly to stdout/stderr instead of by line
  - `replacing` - Stdout is replaced each time, stderr is printed as is
  - `timed` - Only show stdout lines if they are displayed for more than 1 second
  - `keep-order` - Print stdout/stderr by line, prefixed with the task's label, but keep the order of the output
  - `quiet` - Don't show extra output
  - `silent` - Don't show any output including stdout and stderr from the task except for errors

  **Environment Variable:** `MISE_TASK_OUTPUT`
- **`-q --quiet`** — Don't show extra output

  **Environment Variable:** `MISE_QUIET`
- **`-r --raw`** — Read/write directly to stdin/stdout/stderr instead of by line Redactions are not applied with this option Configure with `raw` config or `MISE_RAW` env var
- **`-s --shell <SHELL>`** — Shell to use to run toml tasks

  Defaults to `sh -o errexit -c` on unix, and `cmd /c` on Windows Can also be set with the setting `MISE_UNIX_DEFAULT_INLINE_SHELL_ARGS` or `MISE_WINDOWS_DEFAULT_INLINE_SHELL_ARGS` Or it can be overridden with the `shell` property on a task.
- **`-S --silent`** — Don't show any output except for errors

  **Environment Variable:** `MISE_SILENT`
- **`-t --tool <TOOL@VERSION>`** — Tool(s) to run in addition to what is in mise.toml files e.g.: node@20 python@3.10
- **`--allow-env <VAR>`** — Allow specific env var through (implies --deny-env for everything else) Supports wildcards, e.g. --allow-env='MYAPP\_\*'
- **`--allow-net <HOST>`** — Allow network to specific host (implies --deny-net for everything else) Per-host filtering is unsupported on Linux and returns an error. See the sandboxing guide for current macOS host-filter limitations. On Windows, sandboxing is unavailable: mise warns and runs without host filtering.
- **`--allow-read <PATH>`** — Allow reads from specific path (implies --deny-read for everything else)
- **`--allow-write <PATH>`** — Allow writes to specific path (implies --deny-write for everything else)
- **`--deny-all`** — Block reads, writes, network, and env vars
- **`--deny-env`** — Block env var inheritance except PATH, HOME, USER, SHELL, TERM, COLORTERM, LANG
- **`--deny-net`** — Block all network access
- **`--deny-read`** — Block filesystem reads (system libs and tool dirs still accessible)
- **`--deny-write`** — Block all filesystem writes
- **`--fresh-env`** — Bypass the environment cache and recompute the environment
- **`--no-cache`** — Do not use cache on remote tasks

  **Environment Variable:** `MISE_TASK_REMOTE_NO_CACHE`
- **`--no-deps`** — Skip automatic dependency preparation
- **`--no-timings`** — Hide the elapsed time printed after each task completes

  Set `MISE_TASK_TIMINGS=0` to hide it by default
- **`--skip-deps`** — Run only the specified tasks skipping all dependencies

  **Environment Variable:** `MISE_TASK_SKIP_DEPENDS`
- **`--skip-tools`** — Skip installing tools before running tasks

  Can also be set persistently with the `task.run_auto_install` setting or `MISE_TASK_RUN_AUTO_INSTALL=false` env var
- **`--task-cache <TASK_CACHE>`** — Set task output cache access for this run
  - `read-write` - Read cached results and write new results
  - `read-only` - Read cached results without writing new results
  - `write-only` - Write new results without reading cached results
  - `off` - Disable task output caching
  - `local-only` - Read and write only the local cache; currently equivalent to `read-write`

  **Choices:** `read-write`, `read-only`, `write-only`, `off`, `local-only`

  **Default:** `read-write`

  **Environment Variable:** `MISE_TASK_CACHE`
- **`--task-cache-explain`** — Explain the inputs that produced each task's output cache key
- **`--task-cache-explain-json`** — Output cache-key input details as JSON Lines without running tasks
- **`--task-cache-stats`** — Report task output cache hits, restored bytes, and time saved
- **`--timeout <TIMEOUT>`** — Timeout for the task to complete e.g.: 30s, 5m

## Examples [​](#examples)

Run the "lint" task, defined either in mise.toml or as a standalone script.

```
mise run lint
```

Force the "build" task to run even if its sources are up to date.

```
mise run --force build
```

Run "test" with stdin/stdout/stderr all connected to the current terminal. This forces `--jobs=1` to prevent interleaving of output.

```
mise run --raw test
```

Run the "lint", "test", and "check" tasks in parallel.

```
mise run lint ::: test ::: check
```

Run multiple tasks, each with its own arguments.

```
mise run cmd1 arg1 arg2 ::: cmd2 arg1 arg2
```
