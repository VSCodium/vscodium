mise upgrade

upgrade` [​](#mise-upgrade)

- **Usage:** `mise upgrade [FLAGS] [INSTALLED_TOOL@VERSION]…`
- **Aliases:** `up`
- **Effect:** modifies state
- **Source code:** [`src/cli/upgrade.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/cli/upgrade.rs)

Upgrade outdated tools

By default, this keeps the range specified in mise.toml: with node@20 set, it upgrades to the latest 20.x.x available. Use `--bump` to upgrade to the latest version overall and rewrite the version in mise.toml.

This also updates mise.lock if lockfiles are enabled, see <https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#lockfile>

## Arguments [​](#arguments)

- **`[INSTALLED_TOOL@VERSION]…`** — Tool(s) to upgrade e.g.: node@20 python@3.10 If not specified, all current tools will be upgraded

## Flags [​](#flags)

- **`-b --bump`** — Upgrade to the latest version available, bumping the version in mise.toml

  For example, if you have `node = "20.0.0"` in your mise.toml but 22.1.0 is the latest available, this will install 22.1.0 and set `node = "22.1.0"` in your config.

  It keeps the same precision as what was there before, so if you instead had `node = "20"`, it would change your config to `node = "22"`.
- **`-i --interactive`** — Choose which tools to upgrade from a multiselect menu
- **`-j --jobs <JOBS>`** — Number of jobs to run in parallel Values below 1 are treated as 1 Defaults to the `jobs` setting

  **Environment Variable:** `MISE_JOBS`
- **`-n --dry-run`** — Print what would be done without doing it
- **`-x --exclude <INSTALLED_TOOL>`** — Tool(s) to exclude from upgrading e.g.: go python
- **`--dry-run-code`** — Like --dry-run but exits with code 1 if there are outdated tools

  This is useful for scripts to check if tools need to be upgraded.
- **`--inactive`** — Upgrade all tools, including installed-but-inactive tools not present in the current config
- **`--local`** — Only upgrade tools defined in local config files

  This will only upgrade tools that are defined in project-local mise.toml and will skip tools defined in the global config (\~/.config/mise/config.toml).
- **`--minimum-release-age <MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE>`** — Only upgrade to versions released before this date or older than this duration

  Supports absolute dates like "2024-06-01" and relative durations like "90d" or "1y". This can be useful for reproducibility or security purposes.

  This only affects fuzzy version matches like "20" or "latest". Explicitly pinned versions like "22.5.0" are not filtered.
- **`--monorepo`** — Placeholder for future monorepo upgrades; `mise upgrade --monorepo` is not implemented yet.
- **`--no-prune`** — Do not uninstall the versions that were upgraded away from

  The old version is left in place and is not scheduled for removal. Use this when something outside mise points at the install directory.

  Set `upgrade.auto_prune = false` to make this the default.
- **`--prune`** — Immediately uninstall the versions that were upgraded away from

  Use this to bypass `upgrade.prune_after`, or to override `upgrade.auto_prune = false` for a single run.
- **`--raw`** — Connect backend install command stdin/stdout/stderr directly to the terminal. Implies `--jobs=1`
- **`-h --help`** — Print help

## Examples [​](#examples)

Upgrades node to the latest version matching the range in mise.toml

```
mise upgrade node
```

Upgrades node to the latest version and bumps the version in mise.toml

```
mise upgrade node --bump
```

Upgrades all configured tools within their current requests

```
mise upgrade
```

Upgrades all tools to the latest versions and bumps the version in mise.toml

```
mise upgrade --bump
```

Just print what would be done, don't actually do it

```
mise upgrade --dry-run
```

Upgrades node and python within their current requests

```
mise upgrade node python
```

Upgrade all tools except go

```
mise upgrade --exclude go
```

Show a multiselect menu to choose which tools to upgrade

```
mise upgrade --interactive
```

Only upgrade tools defined in local mise.toml, not global ones

```
mise upgrade --local
```

Deprecation:

The `-l` shorthand for `--bump` is deprecated and will be removed in mise 2027.8.5. After removal, `-l` will become shorthand for `--local`. Use `-b` or `--bump` instead.
