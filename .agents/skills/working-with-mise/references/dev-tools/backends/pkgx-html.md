pkgx Backend

pkgx Backend experimental [​](#pkgx-backend)

The `pkgx` backend installs packages from the [pkgx pantry](https://github.com/pkgxdev/pantry) without shelling out to the `pkgx` CLI. mise resolves pantry metadata, downloads pkgx bottles from `dist.pkgx.dev`, verifies bottle checksums when available, and writes wrapper scripts that set the package runtime environment.

This backend is experimental. Enable it for the project in `mise.toml`:

toml

```
[settings]
experimental = true
```

Or prefix an individual command with `MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1`.

## Usage [​](#usage)

Install a pkgx package by its pantry project name. This is often a domain and path rather than the executable name:

sh

```
mise use pkgx:stedolan.github.io/jq@1.7.1
mise exec -- jq --version
```

The version will be set in `mise.toml` with the following format:

toml

```
[tools]
"pkgx:stedolan.github.io/jq" = "1.7.1"
```

## Lockfiles [​](#lockfiles)

The pkgx backend supports [`mise.lock`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/mise-lock.html). Locking records the main bottle URL and checksum on the tool entry, and records transitive pkgx dependencies in the shared `[pkgx-packages]` lockfile section.

sh

```
mise lock
mise install --locked
```

With `--locked`, mise requires a lockfile URL for the current platform and fails instead of performing a live pantry resolution if the lockfile is missing or incomplete.

## Notes [​](#notes)

- This backend currently supports platforms that pkgx publishes bottles for.
- Version requirements are resolved from pkgx pantry metadata using npm-style semver ranges.
- The runtime environment from pantry manifests is applied through generated wrappers.

## Troubleshooting [​](#troubleshooting)

Use `mise ls-remote pkgx:stedolan.github.io/jq` to check the package identifier and available versions. A version still needs bottles for your platform and its transitive dependencies. Use `mise exec -- jq --version` to verify the generated launcher and runtime environment.

Do not bypass the launcher by copying its underlying binary elsewhere: the wrapper supplies the pantry-defined library paths and environment. For locked installs, keep the shared `pkgx-packages` entries as well as the top-level tool entry.
