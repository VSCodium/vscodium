HTTP Backend

HTTP Backend [​](#http-backend)

The `http` backend installs a binary, script, or archive from a direct download URL. Use it when the publisher has no supported release backend or when you host your own artifacts. Prefer HTTPS URLs and record an expected checksum.

The code for this is inside the mise repository at [`./src/backend/http.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/backend/http.rs).

## Usage [​](#usage)

Replace the example URL with an artifact for your platform, then install it in the current project:

sh

```
mise use 'http:my-tool[url=https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz]@1.0.0'
mise exec -- my-tool --version
```

This records the URL and version in `mise.toml`. Add `-g` for a global tool:

toml

```
[tools]
"http:my-tool" = { version = "1.0.0", url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz" }
```

A fixed URL needs a concrete version label. `latest` does not discover releases from a download URL: add [`version_list_url`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/http.html#version-list-url) to enable `mise ls-remote` and automatic version selection. Updating the version alone does not change a static URL; use a URL template for versioned artifacts.

## Supported HTTP Syntax [​](#supported-http-syntax)

- **HTTP with URL parameter:** `http:my-tool[url=https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz]@1.0.0`

## Tool Options [​](#tool-options)

The following [tool-options](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/#tool-options) are available for the `http` backend—these go in `[tools]` in `mise.toml`.

### `url` (Required) [​](#url-required)

Specifies the HTTP URL to download the tool from. The URL supports templating with variables like `version`, `os()`, and `arch()`:

toml

```
[tools]
"http:my-tool" = { version = "1.0.0", url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v{{version}}.tar.gz" }
```

You can also use static URLs without templating:

toml

```
[tools]
"http:my-tool" = { version = "1.0.0", url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz" }
```

#### Template Variables [​](#template-variables)

The following template functions are available in URLs (use double curly braces, e.g., `version` becomes `{{version}}`):

- `version` - The tool version
- `os()` - Operating system: `macos`, `linux`, or `windows`
- `arch()` - Architecture: `x64` or `arm64`
- `os_family()` - OS family: `unix` or `windows`

The `os()` and `arch()` functions support remapping for tools that use different naming conventions:

toml

```
[tools]
# HashiCorp tools use "darwin" instead of "macos" and "amd64" instead of "x64"
"http:sentinel" = {
  version = "0.26.3",
  url = 'https://releases.hashicorp.com/sentinel/{{version}}/sentinel_{{version}}_{{os(macos="darwin")}}_{{arch(x64="amd64")}}.zip',
}
```

This produces URLs like:

- macOS arm64: `sentinel_0.26.3_darwin_arm64.zip`
- macOS x64: `sentinel_0.26.3_darwin_amd64.zip`
- Linux x64: `sentinel_0.26.3_linux_amd64.zip`

### Platform-specific URLs [​](#platform-specific-urls)

For tools that need different downloads per platform, use the table format:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"

[tools."http:my-tool".platforms]
macos-x64 = { url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0-macos-x64.tar.gz" }
macos-arm64 = { url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz" }
linux-x64 = { url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz" }
```

TIP

You can use either `macos` or `darwin`, and `x64` or `amd64` for platform keys. `macos` and `x64` are preferred in documentation and examples, but all variants are accepted.

OS/architecture values use mise's conventions: `linux`, `macos`, `windows` for operating systems and `x64`, `arm64` for architectures. For platform-specific URLs, use the appropriate platform key (e.g., `macos-x64`, `linux-arm64`) and specify the full URL for each platform.

If you slip and use something like `darwin-aarch64`, mise will try to figure out what you meant and do the right thing anyway.

### `checksum` [​](#checksum)

Provide the full expected digest from a trusted source. The following value is a placeholder and must be replaced before installation:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz"
checksum = "sha256:REPLACE_WITH_THE_64_HEX_DIGIT_DIGEST"
```

*Instead of specifying the checksum here, you can use [mise.lock](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/mise-lock.html) to manage checksums.*

### Platform-specific Checksums [​](#platform-specific-checksums)

Replace each placeholder with the digest for that platform's artifact:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"

[tools."http:my-tool".platforms]
macos-x64 = {
  url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0-macos-x64.tar.gz",
  checksum = "sha256:REPLACE_WITH_THE_64_HEX_DIGIT_DIGEST",
}
macos-arm64 = {
  url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz",
  checksum = "sha256:REPLACE_WITH_THE_64_HEX_DIGIT_DIGEST",
}
linux-x64 = {
  url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz",
  checksum = "sha256:REPLACE_WITH_THE_64_HEX_DIGIT_DIGEST",
}
```

### `checksum_url` [​](#checksum-url)

URL of a published checksum source. When set, [`mise lock`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/mise-lock.html) resolves checksums for every target platform — including platforms other than the one you are running on — **without downloading the artifacts**. This lets a single machine produce a complete, cross-platform lockfile.

`checksum_url` is a template (it supports `{{ version }}`, `{{ os() }}`, and `{{ arch() }}`, and can be set per platform via `platforms.<key>.checksum_url`). It may point at any of:

- an **individual checksum file** (e.g. `<artifact>.sha256`), which may contain just the hash or `<hash> <filename>`;
- a **SHASUMS**-style file listing `<hash> <filename>` for many platforms (the row is matched by the artifact's filename);
- a **manifest** (e.g. JSON), combined with `checksum_expr` below.

For individual and SHASUMS checksum files, the algorithm is detected from the file's name (`*.sha512`, `SHA512SUMS`, `*.md5`, `*.b3`, defaulting to sha256).

toml

```
# Individual checksum file (one per artifact)
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-{{ version }}-{{ os() }}-{{ arch() }}.tar.gz"
checksum_url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-{{ version }}-{{ os() }}-{{ arch() }}.tar.gz.sha256"

# SHASUMS (one file lists every platform)
[tools."http:other-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = 'https://example.com/{{ version }}/other_{{ version }}_{{ os(macos="darwin") }}_{{ arch(x64="amd64") }}.zip'
checksum_url = 'https://example.com/{{ version }}/other_{{ version }}_SHASUMS'
```

### `checksum_expr` [​](#checksum-expr)

When the checksum lives in a manifest (rather than a plain checksum file), use `checksum_expr` to extract it. The manifest body fetched from `checksum_url` is evaluated with [expr-lang](https://expr-lang.org). The following variables are available: `body` (the raw manifest), `version`, `os`, `arch`, `url` (the resolved artifact URL for the target), and `filename`.

The expression must evaluate to a qualified `algo:hash` **string** (e.g. `sha256:<hash>`, `sha512:<hash>`). Build the prefix in the expression: prepend a literal when the algorithm is fixed (`"sha256:" + entry.hash`), or read it from the manifest when it varies (`entry.algo + ":" + entry.hash`).

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.10.0"
checksum_url = "https://example.com/versions.json"
# Match the file whose url equals the resolved artifact url, return sha256:<hash>
checksum_expr = '"sha256:" + filter(fromJSON(body)[version + ""].files, { #.url == url })[0].sha256'

[tools."http:my-tool".platforms]
linux-x64 = { url = "https://example.com/my-tool-{{ version }}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz" }
macos-arm64 = { url = "https://example.com/my-tool-{{ version }}-macos-arm64.tar.gz" }
```

expr-lang gotchas

The predicate placeholder must be written as `{ #... }` **with a space** after `{`, because `{#` is the Tera comment delimiter. To index a map by a runtime value, force evaluation with `[version + ""]` — a bare `[version]` is treated as the literal key `"version"`.

### `size` [​](#size)

Check the expected byte count. These numbers illustrate the syntax; use the actual artifact sizes. A size check does not replace a checksum:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz"
size = "12345678"
```

### Platform-specific Size [​](#platform-specific-size)

You can specify different sizes for different platforms:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"

[tools."http:my-tool".platforms]
macos-x64 = {
  url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0-macos-x64.tar.gz",
  size = "12345678",
}
macos-arm64 = {
  url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz",
  size = "9876543",
}
linux-x64 = {
  url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz",
  size = "11111111",
}
```

### `strip_components` [​](#strip-components)

Number of directory components to strip when extracting archives:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz"
strip_components = 1
```

INFO

When both `strip_components` and `bin_path` are unset, mise automatically applies `strip_components = 1` when the extracted archive contains exactly one directory at the root level and no files. This is common with tools like ripgrep that package their binaries in a versioned directory (e.g., `ripgrep-14.1.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/rg`). Auto-detection ensures the binary is placed directly in the install path where mise expects it.

### `bin` [​](#bin)

Rename the downloaded binary to a specific name. This is useful when downloading single binaries that have platform-specific names:

toml

```
[tools."http:docker-compose"]
version = "2.29.1"
url = "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v{{ version }}/docker-compose-linux-x86_64"
bin = "docker-compose"  # Rename from docker-compose-linux-x86_64 to docker-compose
```

INFO

When downloading single binaries (not archives), mise automatically removes OS/arch suffixes from the filename. For example, `docker-compose-linux-x86_64` becomes `docker-compose`. Use the `bin` option only when you need a specific custom name.

### `rename_exe` [​](#rename-exe)

Rename the executable inside an extracted archive to a specific name. This is useful when archives contain binaries with platform-specific names or when installing kubectl plugins that need specific naming:

toml

```
[tools."http:openunison-cli"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "https://nexus.tremolo.io/repository/openunison-cli/openunison-cli-v{{version}}-linux.zip"
rename_exe = "kubectl-openunison-cli"  # Rename extracted binary for kubectl plugin
```

mise searches for the first executable in the extracted directory (or in `bin_path` if specified) and renames it to the given name.

To rename **multiple** binaries from one archive, use the table form — each key is a source name (an exact file name or a glob) and each value is the new name:

toml

```
[tools."http:mytool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "https://example.com/mytool-v{{version}}-linux.zip"
rename_exe = { "mytool-*" = "mytool", "myhelper-*" = "myhelper" }
```

TIP

Use `bin` for renaming single binary downloads, and `rename_exe` for renaming executables inside archives.

### `format` [​](#format)

Explicitly specify the archive format when the URL lacks a file extension or has an incorrect extension:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0"
format = "tar.xz"  # Explicitly specify the format
```

INFO

If `format` is not specified, mise automatically detects the format from the final URL after HTTP redirects, falling back to the configured URL. This allows an extensionless download endpoint to redirect to an archive such as `.tar.gz`. An explicit `format` always takes precedence, so use it when neither URL has a useful extension or when you need to override the detected format.

### Platform-specific Format [​](#platform-specific-format)

You can specify different formats for different platforms:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"

[tools."http:my-tool".platforms]
macos-x64 = {
  url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0-macos-x64",
  format = "tar.xz",
}
linux-x64 = {
  url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0-linux-x64",
  format = "tar.gz",
}
windows-x64 = {
  url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0-windows-x64",
  format = "zip",
}
```

### `version_list_url` [​](#version-list-url)

Fetch available versions from a remote URL. This lets `mise ls-remote` list versions for HTTP-based tools:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v{{version}}.tar.gz"
version_list_url = "https://example.com/releases/versions.txt"
```

The version list URL can return data in any of these formats:

- **Plain text**: A single version number (e.g., `2.0.53`)
- **Line-separated**: One version per line
- **JSON array of strings**: `["1.0.0", "1.1.0", "2.0.0"]`
- **JSON array of objects**: `[{"version": "1.0.0"}, {"tag_name": "v2.0.0"}]`
- **JSON object with versions array**: `{"versions": ["1.0.0", "2.0.0"]}`

Version prefixes like `v` are automatically stripped.

mise preserves the order returned by the version source. By default, version resolution treats the last matching entry as the latest one. If the source returns semantic versions in another order, set `version_order = "semver"` to order `mise ls-remote` and select versions by semantic precedence. See [Version ordering](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/#version-ordering) for the complete ordering contract.

GitHub's releases API, for example, returns releases newest first. Opt into semantic ordering when using it as an HTTP version source:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "latest"
version_order = "semver"
url = "https://example.com/my-tool-{{ version }}.tar.gz"
version_list_url = "https://api.github.com/repos/owner/my-tool/releases"
version_json_path = ".[].tag_name"
```

### `version_regex` [​](#version-regex)

Extract versions from the version list URL response using a regular expression:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v{{version}}.tar.gz"
version_list_url = "https://example.com/releases/"
version_regex = 'my-tool-v(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\.tar\.gz'
```

The first capturing group is used as the version. If no capturing group is present, the entire match is used.

### `version_json_path` [​](#version-json-path)

Extract versions from JSON responses using a jq-like path expression:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v{{version}}.tar.gz"
version_list_url = "https://api.example.com/releases"
version_json_path = ".[].tag_name"
```

Supported path expressions:

- `.` - root value
- `.[]` - iterate over array elements
- `.[].field` - extract field from each array element
- `.field` - extract field from object
- `.field[]` - iterate over array in field
- `.field.subfield` - nested field access
- `.data.versions[]` - complex nested paths
- `.[?field=value]` - filter array elements where field equals value

Examples:

toml

```
# GitHub releases API format
version_json_path = ".[].tag_name"
```

toml

```
# Nested versions array
version_json_path = ".data.versions[]"
```

toml

```
# Release info objects
version_json_path = ".releases[].info.version"
```

toml

```
# Filter for stable releases only (e.g., Flutter)
version_json_path = ".releases[?channel=stable].version"
```

The filter syntax `[?field=value]` filters JSON arrays before extraction. This is useful for APIs that return multiple release channels (stable, beta, dev) when you only want one of them.

### `version_expr` [​](#version-expr)

Extract versions using an [expr-lang](https://expr-lang.org/) expression. This is the most flexible option for complex version extraction:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "latest"
url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v{{ version }}.tar.gz"
version_list_url = "https://example.com/versions.txt"
version_expr = 'split(body, "\n")'
```

The expression receives the HTTP response body as the `body` variable and should return an array of version strings. It also receives `versions`, which contains values already extracted by `version_regex` or `version_json_path` and is empty when no earlier extractor produced values.

Example expressions:

toml

```
# Split newline-separated versions
version_expr = 'split(body, "\n")'
```

toml

```
# Split and filter empty lines
version_expr = 'filter(split(body, "\n"), # != "")'
```

toml

```
# Parse JSON and extract object keys (useful for HashiCorp-style JSON)
# e.g., {"versions": {"1.0.0": {}, "2.0.0": {}}}
version_expr = 'keys(fromJSON(body).versions)'
```

toml

```
# Sort versions with mise's version-aware comparator
version_expr = 'fromJSON(body) | map({ trimPrefix(#.tag_name, "v") }) | sortVersions()'
```

The [expr-lang](https://expr-lang.org/) library provides built-in functions including:

- **`fromJSON(string)`**: Parse a JSON string into a value
- **`toJSON(value)`**: Convert a value to a JSON string
- **`keys(map)`**: Get the keys of an object/map as an array
- **`values(map)`**: Get the values of an object/map as an array
- **`len(value)`**: Get the length of a string, array, or map
- **`filter(array, predicate)`** and **`map(array, predicate)`**: Filter or transform array values
- **`sort(array)`** and **`reverse(array)`**: Reorder values lexically
- **`int(value)`**, **`float(value)`**, and **`string(value)`**: Convert compatible values

mise adds **`sortVersions(array)`** for version-aware ordering. Prefer `version_order = "semver"` when the discovered versions follow semantic versioning; use `sortVersions()` when the expression itself needs a sorted intermediate value.

TIP

`version_expr` is the final extraction step, so its result becomes the version list. Use the `versions` variable to post-process values produced by `version_regex` or `version_json_path`.

### `bin_path` [​](#bin-path)

Use paths relative to the extracted install root. Setting `bin_path` disables automatic root stripping. For an archive shaped like `my-tool-1.0.0/bin/my-tool`, explicitly strip the outer directory as below, or leave it in place and use `bin_path = "my-tool-/bin"`.

Specify the directory containing binaries within the extracted archive, or where to place the downloaded file. This supports templating with `{{version}}`:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz"
strip_components = 1
bin_path = "bin"
```

**Binary path lookup order:**

1. If `bin_path` is specified, use that directory
2. If `bin_path` is not set, look for a `bin/` directory in the install path
3. If no `bin/` directory exists, search subdirectories for `bin/` directories
4. If no `bin/` directories are found, use the root of the extracted directory

### `shared_extraction` [​](#shared-extraction)

By default, each HTTP installation contains its own extracted files. Set `shared_extraction = true` to share extracted content between normal user installations with identical artifacts and extraction options:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz"
shared_extraction = true
```

Sharing saves disk space when several tools use the same artifact and avoids repeated extraction. A download may still be needed to identify its content. Changes made to shared files, including by a `postinstall` hook, affect every installation using that entry.

Explicit `mise install --system`, `mise install --shared`, and `mise install-into` destinations always contain their own files, even with this option enabled.

## Installation and Cleanup [​](#installation-and-cleanup)

New HTTP installations contain their files directly in the installation directory, like other tools. `mise uninstall` and `mise prune` remove those files when they remove the version. Multiple installations of the same artifact have separate copies.

Existing installations that link into `http-tarballs` continue to work. To replace one with an independent installation, reinstall it with `mise install --force <tool>` without `shared_extraction = true`. Changing the option alone does not replace an already installed version.

Shared extraction storage

Legacy installations and tools using `shared_extraction = true` depend on files in `$MISE_DATA_DIR/http-tarballs/`. Neither `mise prune` nor `mise cache prune` automatically reclaims these entries after uninstalling a tool. Reinstalling also leaves existing entries intact because other installations may use them. Do not delete this directory while any installation still depends on it.

## Caching Behavior [​](#caching-behavior)

### Cache Location [​](#cache-location)

With `shared_extraction = true`, extracted files are stored in `$MISE_DATA_DIR/http-tarballs/` instead of separately in each installation:

- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/mise/http-tarballs/`
- **macOS**: `~/.local/share/mise/http-tarballs/`

### Cache Key Generation [​](#cache-key-generation)

Cache keys are derived from the file content so that identical downloads are shared across tools:

1. **File content**: mise calculates a Blake3 hash of the downloaded file, independently of its expected verification checksum.
2. **Extraction options**: options that change the extracted result, including the effective filename for raw and compressed binaries, root stripping, renaming, and relevant format or launcher choices, also affect the key.

Example cache directory structure:

```
~/.local/share/mise/http-tarballs/
├── 71f774faa03daf1a58cc3339f8c73e6557348c8e0a2f3fb8148cc26e26bad83f/
│   ├── bin/my-tool
│   └── metadata.json
└── 1c2af379bdf1fed266bc44b49271e2df5b0dafae09f1cc744b3505ec50c84719_strip_1/
    ├── my-tool
    └── metadata.json
```

### Symlinked Installations [​](#symlinked-installations)

Installations opting into sharing link to the cached extracted content:

bash

```
~/.local/share/mise/installs/http-my-tool/1.0.0 → ~/.local/share/mise/http-tarballs/71f774...
```

For a raw file with `bin_path`, the link is inside the installation directory. For this layout, Windows copies the file instead of symlinking it.

### Cache Metadata [​](#cache-metadata)

Each cache entry includes a `metadata.json` file with information about the cached content:

json

```
{
  "url": "https://example.com/releases/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz",
  "checksum": "sha256:REPLACE_WITH_THE_64_HEX_DIGIT_DIGEST",
  "size": 1024000,
  "extracted_at": 1703001234,
  "platform": "macos-arm64"
}
```

### Cache Management [​](#cache-management)

Shared extraction storage is intentionally outside `MISE_CACHE_DIR`, so `mise cache clear` does not remove content that installed symlinks still reference.

Default installations and explicit system, shared, and install-into destinations do not create persistent HTTP extraction entries.
