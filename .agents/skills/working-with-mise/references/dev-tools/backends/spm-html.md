SPM Backend

SPM Backend [​](#spm-backend)

You may install executables managed by [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager) directly from GitHub or GitLab releases.

The code for this backend is in the mise repository at [`./src/backend/spm.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/backend/spm.rs).

When a release publishes a SwiftPM artifact bundle (`*.artifactbundle.zip`), mise uses the prebuilt executable from the bundle when it matches the current Swift target triple. If no matching bundle is available, mise falls back to building the package from source unless artifact bundles are explicitly required.

## Dependencies [​](#dependencies)

This backend needs Swift even for artifact bundles, because mise asks Swift for the target triple. Source builds also need Git and the package's build dependencies. You can install it [manually](https://www.swift.org/install) or [with mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/lang/swift.html).

NOTE

If you have Xcode installed and selected in your system via `xcode-select`, Swift is already available through the toolchain embedded in the Xcode installation.

## Usage [​](#usage)

With the required Swift toolchain available, install Tuist in the current project on macOS:

sh

```
mise use spm:tuist/tuist
mise exec -- tuist --help
```

This writes the following to `mise.toml`. Add `-g` for global configuration. Check the package's required Swift/Xcode version before building from source.

toml

```
[tools]
"spm:tuist/tuist" = "latest"
```

If the release provides only a SwiftPM artifact bundle, mise can install the bundle directly:

sh

```
mise use spm:giginet/swift-testing-revolutionary@0.4.0
mise exec -- swift-testing-revolutionary --help
```

The project configuration is:

toml

```
[tools]
"spm:giginet/swift-testing-revolutionary" = "0.4.0"
```

### Supported Syntax [​](#supported-syntax)

| Description | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub shorthand for latest release version | `spm:tuist/tuist` |
| GitHub shorthand for specific release version | `spm:tuist/tuist@4.15.0` |
| GitHub url for latest release version | `spm:https://github.com/tuist/tuist.git` |
| GitHub url for specific release version | `spm:https://github.com/tuist/tuist.git@4.15.0` |
| GitHub shorthand for a specific commit | `spm:owner/repo@rev:<commit>` |
| GitHub url for a specific commit | `spm:https://github.com/owner/repo.git@rev:<commit>` |

Other syntax may work but is unsupported and untested.

Commit selectors (`rev:<commit>` and the compatible `ref:<commit>` form) always build the package from source. Use a full commit SHA for a reproducible installation. Artifact bundles are release assets and cannot be combined with a commit selector.

## Tool Options [​](#tool-options)

The following [tool-options](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/#tool-options) are available for the backend — these go in `[tools]` in `mise.toml`.

### `install_env` [​](#install-env)

Set environment variables for Swift Package Manager commands such as `swift package dump-package`, `swift -print-target-info`, and `swift build`. For artifact bundle installs, this only applies to `swift -print-target-info`; the download, extract, and symlink steps are handled by mise directly. On macOS, for a system Swift toolchain, select the Xcode developer directory with:

toml

```
[tools]
"spm:tuist/tuist" = { version = "latest", install_env = { DEVELOPER_DIR = "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer" } }
```

### `provider` [​](#provider)

Set the provider type to use for fetching assets and release information. Either `github` or `gitlab` (the default is `github`). If you use shorthand notation with `api_url` for a self-hosted repository, set `provider` explicitly, since the type usually cannot be derived from the URL.

toml

```
[tools]
"spm:patricklorran/ios-settings" = { version = "latest", provider = "gitlab" }
```

### `api_url` [​](#api-url)

Set the URL for the provider's API. This is useful when using a self-hosted instance.

toml

```
[tools]
"spm:acme/my-tool" = { version = "latest", provider = "gitlab", api_url = "https://gitlab.acme.com/api/v4" }
```

### `artifactbundle` [​](#artifactbundle)

Control whether SwiftPM artifact bundles are used. When unset, mise tries a matching `*.artifactbundle.zip` release asset first and falls back to building from source if no matching bundle is available.

Set `artifactbundle = true` to require an artifact bundle for a tool. If no bundle matches the current Swift target triple, installation fails instead of falling back to a source build.

Set `artifactbundle = false` to skip artifact bundles and always build from source.

toml

```
[tools]
"spm:giginet/swift-testing-revolutionary" = { version = "0.4.0", artifactbundle = true }
"spm:tuist/tuist" = { version = "latest", artifactbundle = false }
```

### `artifactbundle_asset` [​](#artifactbundle-asset)

Select a specific artifact bundle release asset. This is required when a release contains multiple `*.artifactbundle.zip` assets.

toml

```
[tools]
"spm:giginet/swift-testing-revolutionary" = { version = "0.4.0", artifactbundle_asset = "swift-testing-revolutionary.artifactbundle.zip" }
```

### `filter_bins` [​](#filter-bins)

Restrict which executable products are installed from the package or artifact bundle. When unset, every executable product declared in `Package.swift` is built and symlinked into `bin/`, or every matching executable artifact from an artifact bundle is symlinked into `bin/`.

Useful when a package ships helper executables (e.g. test harnesses) that you don't want on your `PATH`. For source builds, filtering happens before `swift build`, so unwanted products are never built.

Accepts a TOML array or a comma-separated string. If any listed name does not match an executable product in the package, installation fails with a clear error.

toml

```
[tools]
"spm:swiftlang/swiftly" = { version = "latest", filter_bins = ["swiftly"] }
# Equivalent string form:
# "spm:swiftlang/swiftly" = { version = "latest", filter_bins = "swiftly" }
```

### `install_command` [​](#install-command)

Run an explicit command from the checked-out package directory instead of discovering executable products and running `swift build --product`. The command uses mise's default inline shell and inherits [`install_env`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/spm.html#install-env) plus the `PATH` for the Swift dependency. `PREFIX` and `MISE_TOOL_INSTALL_PATH` are both set to the tool's installation directory.

This option only applies to source installs and cannot be combined with `filter_bins`. mise never automatically runs a package's Makefile or other installation scripts; the command must be configured explicitly.

Useful for packages whose executable is not the only artifact that has to be installed — for example a package that also ships a dynamic library or Swift modules that its own `make install` target places next to the binary:

toml

```
[tools]
"spm:owner/repo" = { version = "1.2.3", artifactbundle = false, install_command = "make install PREFIX=\"$MISE_TOOL_INSTALL_PATH\"" }
```

Some install scripts exit successfully even when the underlying `swift build` failed, so mise verifies that the command installed at least one executable into `bin/` and fails the install otherwise.

## Settings [​](#settings)

### `spm.artifactbundle_only` [​](#spm-artifactbundle-only)

Set `spm.artifactbundle_only = true` to require SwiftPM artifact bundles for all `spm:` installs. This mirrors `cargo.binstall_only`: mise fails if no matching artifact bundle is available instead of compiling from source.

toml

```
[settings]
spm.artifactbundle_only = true
```

This can also be set with `MISE_SPM_ARTIFACTBUNDLE_ONLY=1`.

## Troubleshooting [​](#troubleshooting)

- **No matching artifact bundle:** check the Swift target triple. Allow a source build only if the package supports your host and its build prerequisites are installed.
- **Unexpected compilation:** set `artifactbundle = true` when a missing prebuilt bundle should fail instead of triggering a source build.
- **No executable products:** confirm the package publishes a CLI, check `filter_bins`, or use an explicit `install_command` when the project has a custom installation process.
