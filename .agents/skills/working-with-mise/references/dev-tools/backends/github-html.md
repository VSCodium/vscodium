GitHub Backend

GitHub Backend [​](#github-backend)

You may install GitHub release assets directly using the `github` backend. This backend downloads release assets from GitHub repositories and is ideal for tools that distribute pre-built binaries through GitHub releases.

The code for this is inside of the mise repository at [`./src/backend/github.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/backend/github.rs).

## Usage [​](#usage)

Install ripgrep in the current project, then check the selected executable:

sh

```
mise use github:BurntSushi/ripgrep
mise exec -- rg --version
```

This records the following in `mise.toml`. Add `-g` to `mise use` for a global tool.

toml

```
[tools]
"github:BurntSushi/ripgrep" = "latest"
```

Use `mise ls-remote github:BurntSushi/ripgrep` to choose a version, or `mise use github:BurntSushi/ripgrep@VERSION` to select it. Replace `VERSION` with an entry from that list. For API limits or private releases, see [GitHub tokens](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/github-tokens.html).

## Version Listing [​](#version-listing)

`mise ls-remote` lists a repository's releases. **Releases with no assets attached are left out**: mise installs from a release's uploaded assets and never falls back to the auto-generated source archive, so such a release has nothing to install from and listing it would advertise a version that only fails.

This is emptiness, not platform fit — a release whose assets do not cover your platform is still listed, because the version list has to mean the same thing on every host for cross-platform lockfiles to work.

Tools that set a **platform-scoped** `url` — `platforms.<os>-<arch>.url`, or the flat `platform_<os>_<arch>_url` — are exempt: they fetch from that URL instead of selecting a release asset, so their releases are listed whether or not anything is attached to them. A bare top-level `url` is not an exemption, because this backend only reads the option per platform and would still fall through to asset selection.

The exemption is all-or-nothing, for the same reason the filter is: one version list serves every platform. A `url` set for only some platforms therefore keeps asset-less releases listed everywhere, and installing one on a platform the `url` does not cover still fails — exactly as it did before this filtering existed. Cover every platform you support, or leave `url` unset and let asset selection do the work.

mise fetches one page of releases and reads further only until it finds a stable release it can offer. Because an asset-less release is not one, a repository whose newest stable releases have nothing attached is now read past rather than stopped at, up to a small page limit. Set `MISE_LIST_ALL_VERSIONS=1` to read every page.

## Tool Options [​](#tool-options)

The following [tool-options](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/#tool-options) are available for the `github` backend—these go in `[tools]` in `mise.toml`.

### Asset Autodetection [​](#asset-autodetection)

When no `asset_pattern` is specified, mise automatically selects the best asset for your platform. It scores assets based on:

- **OS compatibility** (linux, macos, windows)
- **Architecture compatibility** (x64, arm64, x86, arm)
- **Libc variant** (gnu or musl for Linux, msvc for Windows)
- **Archive format preference** (tar.gz, zip, etc.)
- **Build type** (avoids debug/test builds)

For most tools, you can install without specifying a pattern:

sh

```
mise install github:user/repo
```

TIP

The autodetection logic is implemented in [`src/backend/asset_matcher.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/backend/asset_matcher.rs), which is shared by the GitHub, GitLab, and Forgejo backends.

### `asset_pattern` [​](#asset-pattern)

Specifies the pattern to match against release asset names. This is useful when there are multiple assets for your OS/arch combination or when you need to override autodetection.

toml

```
[tools]
"github:cli/cli" = { version = "latest", asset_pattern = "gh_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz" }
```

Supports the same templating as [`bin_path`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/github.html#bin-path): `{{ version }}` plus the `{{ os() }}` / `{{ arch() }}` functions (with optional remap keyword arguments).

### `additional_asset_patterns` [​](#additional-asset-patterns)

Downloads additional archives from the same release and extracts them into the primary asset's install directory, in the order listed. Use this when an upstream distributes one installation across a base archive and one or more supplemental archives.

For example, Ollama publishes its Linux AMD64 ROCm support as an archive that must be overlaid on the normal Ollama archive:

toml

```
[tools."github:ollama/ollama"]
version = "latest"

[tools."github:ollama/ollama".platforms]
linux-x64 = {
  additional_asset_patterns = ["ollama-linux-amd64-rocm.tar.zst"],
}
```

Each pattern must select exactly one archive. Patterns support the same templating as [`asset_pattern`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/github.html#asset-pattern). Supplemental assets must be archives; bare binaries are not supported. They are extracted without applying the primary asset's `strip_components`, `bin`, or `rename_exe` options. If a supplemental archive contains the same path as an earlier archive, the later archive's file wins.

When lockfiles are enabled, mise records the URL and checksum for each supplemental artifact, plus any available provenance metadata. Provenance is cryptographically verified for the current platform; cross-platform lock entries record detected provenance for verification when installed. `--locked` installations use only the recorded artifact list and fail if it is incomplete.

### `matching` [​](#matching)

Narrows asset selection to names containing the given substring, **while keeping platform autodetection**. Unlike [`asset_pattern`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/github.html#asset-pattern) (which replaces autodetection entirely), `matching` only refines the candidate set — autodetection still chooses the correct OS/arch from the narrowed list, so a single config stays portable across platforms.

This is the option to reach for when a repository ships **multiple binaries as separate per-platform assets** and autodetection can't tell which one you want (see [Multiple Assets from the Same Release](#multiple-assets-from-the-same-release)).

toml

```
[tools]
# oxc-project/oxc ships both oxlint and oxfmt per platform; matching picks oxlint
# on every OS/arch without hardcoding a platform-specific asset_pattern.
# `apps_v1.69.0` is the literal release tag; the assets are per-platform
# archives, and rename_exe renames the extracted `oxlint-<triple>` binary to `oxlint`.
"github:oxc-project/oxc" = { version = "apps_v1.69.0", matching = "oxlint", rename_exe = "oxlint" }
```

Tool options can also be passed inline on the command line using `[key=value]` syntax:

sh

```
mise use "github:oxc-project/oxc[matching=oxlint,rename_exe=oxlint]@apps_v1.69.0"
```

`matching` is a case-sensitive substring test, so a value that is also a substring of another asset's name (e.g. `matching = "tool"` when both `tool-*` and `tool-extras-*` are published) won't uniquely select your binary. Use [`matching_regex`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/github.html#matching-regex) with an anchor when you need a precise match.

If [`asset_pattern`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/github.html#asset-pattern) is also set, it takes precedence and `matching`/`matching_regex` are ignored — `asset_pattern` replaces autodetection entirely, so there is no candidate set left for them to narrow. They are ignored silently: when `asset_pattern` is set, a `matching_regex` is never consulted and an invalid one is not reported, since mise does not error on a superseded option.

The filter also scopes verification: checksums are looked up for the selected asset, and SLSA provenance discovery is narrowed the same way, so a multi-binary release can't verify one binary against another's provenance. A single shared provenance file that attests every artifact in the release (e.g. `multiple.intoto.jsonl`) is still used as a fallback when no per-binary provenance matches.

### `matching_regex` [​](#matching-regex)

Like [`matching`](#matching), but the asset name must match the given regular expression. Use this when a substring isn't selective enough. The match is case-sensitive; use an inline `(?i)` flag for case-insensitive matching.

toml

```
[tools]
"github:oxc-project/oxc" = { version = "apps_v1.69.0", matching_regex = "^oxlint-", rename_exe = "oxlint" }
```

If both `matching` and `matching_regex` are set, an asset must satisfy **both** (logical AND) to remain a candidate.

### `version_prefix` [​](#version-prefix)

Specifies a custom version prefix for release tags. By default, mise handles the common `v` prefix (e.g., `v1.0.0`), but some repositories use different prefixes like `release-`, `version-`, or no prefix at all.

When `version_prefix` is configured, mise will:

- Filter available versions with the prefix and strip it
- Add the prefix when searching for releases
- Try both prefixed and non-prefixed versions during installation

toml

```
[tools]
"github:user/repo" = { version = "latest", version_prefix = "release-" }
```

**Examples:**

- With `version_prefix = "release-"`:
  - User specifies `1.0.0` → mise searches for the `release-1.0.0` tag
  - Available versions show as `1.0.0` (prefix stripped)
- With `version_prefix = ""` (empty string):
  - User specifies `1.0.0` → mise searches for the `1.0.0` tag (no prefix)
  - Useful for repositories that don't use any prefix

### Platform-specific Asset Patterns [​](#platform-specific-asset-patterns)

For different asset patterns per platform:

toml

```
[tools."github:cli/cli"]
version = "latest"

[tools."github:cli/cli".platforms]
linux-x64 = { asset_pattern = "gh_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz" }
macos-arm64 = { asset_pattern = "gh_*_macOS_arm64.zip" }
```

### Platform-specific URLs [​](#platform-specific-urls)

Set `platforms.<os>-<arch>.url` to download from an explicit URL instead of selecting a release asset. Use `{{ version }}` for the resolved tool version, including when the requested version is `latest`.

toml

```
[tools."github:owner/repo"]
version = "latest"
strip_components = 1
platforms.macos-arm64.url = "https://github.com/owner/repo/archive/refs/tags/v{{ version }}.tar.gz"
```

Include any release-tag prefix explicitly in the URL. A top-level `url` is not used by this backend. Direct URLs can be combined with `additional_asset_patterns` to overlay release assets on the downloaded archive. mise extracts the archives; it does not compile source code automatically.

Use separate platform entries for different target URLs. As with other GitHub tool options, platform functions and conditionals in `mise.toml` are evaluated for the host when the configuration is loaded.

### Multiple Assets from the Same Release [​](#multiple-assets-from-the-same-release)

There are two distinct cases:

- If the assets are parts of one installation, use [`additional_asset_patterns`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/github.html#additional-asset-patterns). The supplemental archives are overlaid into the same install directory.
- If the assets are independent tools that should have separate install directories, define one tool alias per binary and point each alias at the same `github:owner/repo` backend.

Prefer [`matching`](#matching) (or [`matching_regex`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/github.html#matching-regex)): it narrows the candidate set while **keeping platform autodetection**, so one config works on every OS/arch. This is the right choice when the per-platform asset names can't be templated portably (e.g. Rust target-triples like `oxlint-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`).

The example below installs both `oxlint` and `oxfmt` from the single `oxc-project/oxc` release. Each `matching` value must be specific enough to select **only** the intended binary — if one binary's name were a substring of the other's, use [`matching_regex`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/github.html#matching-regex) with an anchor (e.g. `"^oxlint-"`) instead (see the [`matching`](#matching) caveat).

toml

```
[tool_alias]
oxlint = "github:oxc-project/oxc"
oxfmt = "github:oxc-project/oxc"

[tools.oxlint]
version = "apps_v1.69.0"
matching = "oxlint"
rename_exe = "oxlint"

[tools.oxfmt]
version = "apps_v1.69.0"
matching = "oxfmt"
rename_exe = "oxfmt"
```

WARNING

Aliases are not an overlay mechanism. Each alias creates a separate install directory. Use them for independent binaries such as `oxlint` and `oxfmt`; use `additional_asset_patterns` when both archives must compose one runnable tool.

If the binary isn't named the way you want to invoke it, add [`rename_exe`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/github.html#rename-exe) (renames the executable extracted from an archive) or [`bin`](#bin) (selects/renames the binary, including a single bare non-archive binary).

Use [`asset_pattern`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/github.html#asset-pattern) instead only when you need full manual control and can name the asset portably (it replaces autodetection, so any `{{ os() }}`/`{{ arch() }}` templating must cover every platform you target):

toml

```
[tool_alias]
tool-a = "github:owner/repo"
tool-b = "github:owner/repo"

[tools.tool-a]
version = "latest"
asset_pattern = "tool-a-*"

[tools.tool-b]
version = "latest"
asset_pattern = "tool-b-*"
```

### `checksum` [​](#checksum)

Set an expected digest for a **specific version and artifact**. Replace the placeholder below with the full SHA-256 digest obtained from a trusted source:

toml

```
[tools."github:owner/repo"]
version = "1.0.0"
asset_pattern = "tool-1.0.0-x64.tar.gz"
checksum = "sha256:REPLACE_WITH_THE_64_HEX_DIGIT_DIGEST"
```

*Instead of specifying the checksum here, you can use [mise.lock](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/mise-lock.html) to manage checksums.*

### Platform-specific Checksums [​](#platform-specific-checksums)

Each platform needs its own digest. These values are placeholders; fill them from the publisher before installing, or generate [mise.lock](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/mise-lock.html).

toml

```
[tools."github:cli/cli"]
version = "2.100.0"

[tools."github:cli/cli".platforms]
linux-x64 = {
  asset_pattern = "gh_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz",
  checksum = "sha256:REPLACE_WITH_THE_64_HEX_DIGIT_DIGEST",
}
macos-arm64 = {
  asset_pattern = "gh_*_macOS_arm64.zip",
  checksum = "sha256:REPLACE_WITH_THE_64_HEX_DIGIT_DIGEST",
}
```

### `size` [​](#size)

Optionally check the expected byte count. The number below is illustrative; use the selected artifact's actual size and pin its version. A size check does not authenticate the publisher or replace a checksum:

toml

```
[tools]
"github:owner/repo" = { version = "1.0.0", size = "12345678" }
```

### `strip_components` [​](#strip-components)

Number of directory components to strip when extracting archives:

toml

```
[tools]
"github:cli/cli" = { version = "latest", strip_components = 1 }
```

INFO

When both `strip_components` and `bin_path` are unset, mise automatically detects when to apply `strip_components = 1`. This happens when the extracted archive contains exactly one directory at the root level and no files. This is common with tools like ripgrep that package their binaries in a versioned directory (e.g., `ripgrep-14.1.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/rg`). The auto-detection ensures the binary is placed directly in the install path where mise expects it.

### `bin` [​](#bin)

Rename the downloaded binary to a specific name. This is useful when downloading single binaries that have platform-specific names:

toml

```
[tools."github:docker/compose"]
version = "2.29.1"
bin = "docker-compose"  # Rename the downloaded binary to docker-compose
```

INFO

When downloading single binaries (not archives), mise automatically removes OS/arch suffixes from the filename. For example, `docker-compose-linux-x86_64` becomes `docker-compose`. Use the `bin` option only when you need a specific custom name.

### `rename_exe` [​](#rename-exe)

Rename the executable after extraction from an archive. This is useful when the archive contains a binary with a platform-specific name that you want to rename:

toml

```
[tools."github:yt-dlp/yt-dlp"]
version = "latest"
asset_pattern = "yt-dlp_linux.zip"
rename_exe = "yt-dlp"  # Rename the extracted binary to yt-dlp
```

The string form renames the tool's primary binary (matched against the repo name). When an archive ships **multiple** binaries that you want to expose under clean names, use the table form instead — each key is a source name (an exact file name or a glob), and each value is the new name:

toml

```
[tools."github:DanielGavin/ols"]
version = "latest"
# archive contains ols-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu and odinfmt-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
rename_exe = { "ols-*" = "ols", "odinfmt-*" = "odinfmt" }
```

Both binaries are renamed and become available on PATH. Missing sources are skipped with a warning, and the executable bit is restored for archives (such as ZIPs) that drop it.

TIP

Use `rename_exe` for archives where the binary inside has a different name than desired. Use `bin` for single binary downloads (non-archives).

### `no_app` [​](#no-app)

Skip macOS .app bundle assets during autodetection and prefer standalone CLI binaries instead. This is useful when a repository provides both a macOS .app bundle (often an Xcode extension or GUI application) and a standalone command-line tool:

toml

```
[tools."github:nicklockwood/SwiftFormat"]
version = "latest"
rename_exe = "swiftformat"
no_app = true  # Skip SwiftFormat.for.Xcode.app.zip, use swiftformat.zip instead
```

When `no_app = true`:

- Assets containing `.app.` (e.g., `Tool.app.zip`, `Tool.for.Xcode.app.zip`) are penalized during autodetection
- Standalone archives (e.g., `tool.zip`, `tool-macos.tar.gz`) are preferred
- The option is mainly useful for macOS asset selection; non-macOS `.app.` assets are already penalized by platform matching
- The option only affects autodetection; explicit `asset_pattern` values are used as-is

INFO

Without this option, mise's autodetection might select .app bundles on macOS, which can be problematic if the bundle contains a GUI application or Xcode extension rather than a standalone CLI tool.

### `bin_path` [​](#bin-path)

Paths are relative to the install directory **after** `strip_components` is applied. Setting `bin_path` disables automatic root stripping. For an archive shaped like `tool-VERSION/bin/tool`, either retain the outer directory and use `bin_path = "tool-/bin"`, or set both `strip_components = 1` and `bin_path = "bin"`.

Specify the directory containing binaries within the extracted archive, or where to place the downloaded file. This supports Tera templating with `{{ version }}` and the `{{ os() }}` / `{{ arch() }}` functions:

toml

```
[tools."github:cli/cli"]
version = "latest"
strip_components = 1
bin_path = "bin" # after the archive's outer directory is stripped
```

Both take keyword arguments that remap the value mise would emit (`linux`, `macos`, `windows` for `os()`; `x64`, `arm64` for `arch()`), for when upstream names the directory differently:

toml

```
[tools."github:pizlonator/fil-c"]
version = "latest"
# expands to filc-0.681-linux-x86_64/build/bin
strip_components = 0
bin_path = 'filc-{{ version }}-{{ os() }}-{{ arch(x64="x86_64", arm64="aarch64") }}/build/bin'
```

TIP

Use a single-quoted TOML string when the template contains double quotes, as above.

There are no bare `{{ os }}` / `{{ arch }}` variables, and no `{{ x86_64_arch }}`-style aliases — `{{ arch(x64="x86_64", arm64="aarch64") }}` is how you get those names.

**Binary path lookup order:**

1. If `bin_path` is specified, use that directory
2. If `bin_path` is not set, look for a `bin/` directory in the install path
3. If the install path root contains an executable file, use the install path root
4. If no `bin/` directory exists, search subdirectories for `bin/` directories
5. If no `bin/` directories are found, search immediate subdirectories for any executable files. If an executable is found directly within a subdirectory, that subdirectory is used as the binary path.
6. If no executables are found, use the root of the extracted directory

### `filter_bins` [​](#filter-bins)

List of binaries to symlink into a filtered `.mise-bins` directory. This is useful when the tool comes with extra binaries that you do not want to expose on PATH.

toml

```
[tools]
"github:jgm/pandoc" = { version = "latest", filter_bins = "pandoc" }
"github:owner/repo" = { version = "latest", filter_bins = ["tool", "helper"] }
```

When enabled:

- A `.mise-bins` subdirectory is created with symlinks only to the specified binaries
- Other binaries (like `pandoc-lua` or `pandoc-server`) are not exposed on PATH

### `api_url` [​](#api-url)

For GitHub Enterprise or self-hosted GitHub instances, specify the API URL. mise uses this URL for release listing and release asset lookup, and may also use it to download assets when browser download URLs are not reachable or when using custom/private instances:

toml

```
[tools]
"github:myorg/mytool" = { version = "latest", api_url = "https://github.mycompany.com/api/v3" }
```

### `github_attestations` [​](#github-attestations)

By default, mise checks GitHub Artifact Attestations when they are available for a GitHub release asset. Set `github_attestations = false` on a single tool to skip that check while keeping GitHub attestation verification enabled globally:

toml

```
[tools]
"github:myorg/mytool" = { version = "latest", github_attestations = false }
```

Use this as a temporary escape hatch for a specific tool if GitHub's attestation service or trusted-root data is causing installs to fail. Other verification paths, such as checksums and SLSA provenance, still run when they are configured and available. If `mise.lock` already records `github-attestations` provenance for the tool, re-run `mise lock` after disabling this option so the lockfile no longer requires a verifier that the tool config has turned off.

### `prerelease` [​](#prerelease)

By default, releases flagged `prerelease: true` on GitHub are excluded from `mise ls-remote` and from `latest` resolution. Set `prerelease = true` to include them:

toml

```
[tools]
"github:myorg/mytool" = { version = "latest", prerelease = true }
```

When set:

- Pre-release tags (e.g. `v1.0.0-rc1`, `v0.1.2-dev.86`) appear in `mise ls-remote`.
- `latest` resolves to the newest version across stable **and** pre-releases, rather than taking the GitHub `/releases/latest` shortcut (which returns whichever release the repo owner has marked as "Latest" — usually the newest non-prerelease, but it can be any release they've pinned via the API).
- Fuzzy version queries (e.g. `1.2`) match pre-release tags under that prefix.

This is useful for repositories whose active releases are all pre-releases (e.g. internal tools shipping continuous dev builds), or when you need to track a project's release candidates. Draft releases are always excluded. The option has no effect on GitLab.

## Self-hosted GitHub [​](#self-hosted-github)

If you are using a self-hosted GitHub instance, set the `api_url` tool option. For authentication, see [GitHub Tokens](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/github-tokens.html#github-enterprise).

## Supported GitHub Syntax [​](#supported-github-syntax)

- **GitHub shorthand for latest release version:** `github:cli/cli`
- **GitHub shorthand for specific release version:** `github:cli/cli@2.40.1`

## Settings [​](#settings)

### `github.credential_command`[](#github.credential_command)

- Type: `string`
- Env: `MISE_GITHUB_CREDENTIAL_COMMAND`
- Default:

When set, mise executes this command via `sh -c` and reads the token from stdout. The hostname is exposed as `MISE_CREDENTIAL_HOST`, making the command host-aware for GitHub Enterprise environments. This replaces the `git credential fill` fallback and does not require `github.use_git_credentials` to be enabled.

The command should print a single token to stdout. Trailing whitespace is trimmed.

Example: `op read "op://Private/GitHub Token/credential"`

### `github.gh_cli_tokens`[](#github.gh_cli_tokens)

- Type: `boolean`
- Env: `MISE_GITHUB_GH_CLI_TOKENS`
- Default: `true`

When enabled, mise will read OAuth tokens from the gh CLI config file (`~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` or `$GH_CONFIG_DIR/hosts.yml`) as a fallback when no `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `MISE_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set.

This supports multiple GitHub Enterprise instances since the gh CLI stores per-host tokens.

Set to `false` to disable this behavior.

### `github.github_attestations`[](#github.github_attestations)

- Type: `boolean`
- Env: `MISE_GITHUB_GITHUB_ATTESTATIONS`
- Default: `true`

Enable/disable GitHub Artifact Attestations verification for github backend tools. When enabled, mise will verify the authenticity and integrity of downloaded tools using GitHub's artifact attestation system.

Attestations are only verified when the tool resolves to the public GitHub API (`https://api.github.com`). Tools that set a custom `api_url` (e.g. GitHub Enterprise Server) skip attestation verification automatically since GHE Server does not implement the attestations endpoint.

### `github.oauth_api_url`[](#github.oauth_api_url)

- Type: `string`
- Env: `MISE_GITHUB_OAUTH_API_URL`
- Default: `https://api.github.com`

GitHub API base URL used to validate native OAuth tokens and associate them with the configured host.

### `github.oauth_auth_url`[](#github.oauth_auth_url)

- Type: `string`
- Env: `MISE_GITHUB_OAUTH_AUTH_URL`
- Default: `https://github.com/login`

OAuth endpoint base URL used by native GitHub device flow. The default is for github.com. Set this for GitHub Enterprise instances that support device flow.

### `github.oauth_client_id`[](#github.oauth_client_id)

- Type: `string`
- Env: `MISE_GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- Default:

When set, mise can create short-lived GitHub App user access tokens using GitHub's OAuth device flow. This does not require a GitHub App private key, client secret, personal access token, or external credential helper.

Run `mise token github --oauth` once to authorize and cache a token. mise will reuse the cached token for GitHub API calls and refresh it when possible.

Inspired by [ghtkn](https://github.com/suzuki-shunsuke/ghtkn).

### `github.oauth_export_env`[](#github.oauth_export_env)

- Type: `string`
- Env: `MISE_GITHUB_OAUTH_EXPORT_ENV`
- Default: `GITHUB_TOKEN`

When `github.oauth_client_id` is configured and a cached or refreshable token is available, mise exports the token under this environment variable so other tools (`gh`, `git`, `cargo`, etc.) can pick it up without an explicit `$(mise token github --oauth --raw)` call. Set to `GH_TOKEN` to use the gh CLI's preferred name, or to an empty string to disable the auto-export.

### `github.oauth_open_browser`[](#github.oauth_open_browser)

- Type: `boolean`
- Env: `MISE_GITHUB_OAUTH_OPEN_BROWSER`
- Default: `true`

When enabled, `mise token github --oauth` will attempt to open GitHub's verification URL in the default browser when the device-code flow is triggered.

### `github.oauth_scopes`[](#github.oauth_scopes)

- Type: `string`
- Env: `MISE_GITHUB_OAUTH_SCOPES`
- Default:

Optional OAuth scope string passed to GitHub's device-code endpoint. GitHub App user access tokens are primarily governed by the app's permissions and installation access, so this usually remains empty.

### `github.slsa`[](#github.slsa)

- Type: `boolean`
- Env: `MISE_GITHUB_SLSA`
- Default: `true`

Enable/disable SLSA provenance verification for github backend tools. When enabled, mise will verify the supply-chain integrity of downloaded tools using SLSA provenance attestations.

### `github.use_git_credentials`[](#github.use_git_credentials)

- Type: `boolean`
- Env: `MISE_GITHUB_USE_GIT_CREDENTIALS`
- Default: `false`

When enabled, mise will run `git credential fill` to obtain GitHub tokens using the credential helpers configured in your `.gitconfig`.

This covers tokens stored in system keyrings (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager), and any other git credential helper.

Used as a last resort — after environment variables, `github_tokens.toml`, and gh CLI tokens are checked. Results are cached per host for the duration of the session.

Set to `true` to enable this behavior.
