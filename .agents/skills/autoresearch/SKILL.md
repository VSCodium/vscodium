# Autoresearch: Autonomous Iterative Experimentation

An autonomous experimentation loop for any programming task. You define the goal and how to measure it; the agent iterates autonomously -- modifying code, running experiments, measuring results, and keeping or discarding changes -- until interrupted.

---

## Agent Behavior Rules

1. **DO** guide the user through the Setup phase interactively before starting the loop.
2. **DO** establish a baseline measurement before making any changes.
3. **DO** commit every experiment attempt before running it (so it can be reverted cleanly).
4. **DO** keep a results log (TSV) tracking every experiment.
5. **DO** revert changes that do not improve the metric (git reset to last known good).
6. **DO** run autonomously once the loop starts -- never pause to ask "should I continue?".
7. **DO NOT** modify files the user marked as out-of-scope.
8. **DO NOT** skip the measurement step -- every experiment must be measured.
9. **DO NOT** keep changes that regress the metric unless the user explicitly allowed trade-offs.
10. **DO NOT** install new dependencies or make environment changes unless the user approved it.

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Interactive)

Before any experimentation begins, work with the user to establish these parameters.
Ask the user directly for each item. Do not assume or skip any.

### 1.1 Define the Goal

Ask the user:

> **What are you trying to improve or optimize?**
>
> Examples: execution time, memory usage, binary size, test pass rate, code coverage,
> API response latency, throughput, error rate, benchmark score, build time, bundle size,
> lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, etc.

Record the user's answer as the **goal**.

### 1.2 Define the Metric

Ask the user:

> **How do we measure success? What exact command produces the metric?**
>
> I need:
> 1. **The command** to run (e.g., `dotnet test`, `npm run benchmark`, `time ./build.sh`, `pytest --tb=short`)
> 2. **How to extract the metric** from the output (e.g., a regex pattern, a specific line, a JSON field)
> 3. **Direction**: Is lower better or higher better?
>
> Example: "Run `dotnet test --logger trx`, count passing tests. Higher is better."
> Example: "Run `hyperfine './my-program'`, extract mean time. Lower is better."

Record:
- `METRIC_COMMAND`: the command to run
- `METRIC_EXTRACTION`: how to extract the numeric metric from output
- `METRIC_DIRECTION`: `lower_is_better` or `higher_is_better`

### 1.3 Define the Scope

Ask the user:

> **Which files or directories am I allowed to modify?**
>
> And which files are OFF LIMITS (read-only)?

Record:
- `IN_SCOPE_FILES`: files/dirs the agent may edit
- `OUT_OF_SCOPE_FILES`: files/dirs that must not be modified

### 1.4 Define Constraints

Ask the user:

> **Are there any constraints I should respect?**
>
> Examples:
> - Time budget per experiment (e.g., "each run should take < 2 minutes")
> - No new dependencies
> - Must keep all existing tests passing
> - Must not change the public API
> - Must maintain backward compatibility
> - VRAM/memory limit
> - Code complexity limits (prefer simpler solutions)

Record as `CONSTRAINTS`.

### 1.5 Define the Experiment Budget (Optional)

Ask the user:

> **How many experiments should I run, or should I just keep going until you stop me?**
>
> You can say a number (e.g., "try 20 experiments") or "unlimited" (I'll run until you interrupt).

Record as `MAX_EXPERIMENTS` (number or `unlimited`).

### 1.6 Simplicity Criterion

Inform the user of the default simplicity policy:

> **Simplicity policy (default):** All else being equal, simpler is better. A small improvement
> that adds ugly complexity is not worth it. Removing code while maintaining or improving
> the metric is a great outcome. I'll weigh the complexity cost against the improvement
> magnitude. Does this policy work for you, or do you want to adjust it?

Record any adjustments as `SIMPLICITY_POLICY`.

### 1.7 Confirm Setup

Summarize all parameters back to the user in a clear table:

| Parameter          | Value                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Goal               | ...                          |
| Metric command     | ...                          |
| Metric extraction  | ...                          |
| Direction          | lower is better / higher ... |
| In-scope files     | ...                          |
| Out-of-scope files | ...                          |
| Constraints        | ...                          |
| Max experiments    | ...                          |
| Simplicity policy  | ...                          |

Ask the user to confirm. Do not proceed until confirmed.

---

## Phase 2: Branch & Baseline

Once the user confirms:

1. **Create a branch**: Propose a tag based on today's date (e.g., `autoresearch/mar17`).
   Create the branch: `git checkout -b autoresearch/<tag>`.

2. **Read in-scope files**: Read all files that are in scope to build full context of the current state.

3. **Initialize results.tsv**: Create `results.tsv` in the repo root with the header row:
   ```
   experiment	commit	metric	status	description
   ```
   Add `results.tsv` and `run.log` to `.git/info/exclude` (append if not already present) so they stay untracked without modifying any tracked files.

4. **Run the baseline**: Execute the metric command on the current unmodified code.
   Record the result as experiment `0` with status `baseline` in `results.tsv`.

5. **Report baseline** to the user:
   > Baseline established: **[metric_name] = [value]**
   > Starting autonomous experimentation loop.

---

## Phase 3: Experiment Loop

Run this loop continuously. Do not stop to ask the user. Run until:
- `MAX_EXPERIMENTS` is reached, OR
- The user manually interrupts

### For each experiment:

```
LOOP:
  1. THINK   - Analyze previous results and the current code.
               Generate an experiment hypothesis.
               Consider: what worked, what didn't, what hasn't been tried.

  2. EDIT    - Modify the in-scope file(s) to implement the idea.
               Keep changes focused and minimal per experiment.

  3. COMMIT  - git add + git commit with a short descriptive message.
               Format: "experiment: <short description of what changed>"

  4. RUN     - Execute the metric command.
               Redirect output to run.log so it does not flood the context window.
               Use shell-appropriate redirection:
               - Bash/Zsh: `<command> > run.log 2>&1`
               - PowerShell: `<command> *> run.log`

  5. MEASURE - Extract the metric from run.log.
               If extraction fails (crash/error), read the last 50 lines
               of run.log for the error.

  6. DECIDE  - Compare metric to the current best:
               - IMPROVED: Keep the commit. Update the "best" baseline.
                 Log status = "keep".
               - SAME OR WORSE: Revert. `git reset --hard HEAD~1`.
                 Log status = "discard".
               - CRASH: Attempt a quick fix (typo, import, simple error).
                 Amend the experiment commit (`git commit --amend`) with the fix
                 and rerun. The experiment keeps its original number.
                 If unfixable after 2 attempts, revert the entire experiment
                 (`git reset --hard HEAD~1`) and log status = "crash".

  7. LOG     - Append a row to results.tsv:
               experiment_number  commit_hash  metric_value  status  description

  8. CONTINUE - Go to step 1.
```

### Experiment Strategy

When generating experiment ideas, follow this priority order:

1. **Low-hanging fruit first**: Simple parameter tweaks, obvious inefficiencies.
2. **Informed by results**: If a direction showed promise, explore further in that direction.
3. **Diversify after plateaus**: If the last 3-5 experiments all failed, try a different approach entirely.
4. **Combine winners**: If experiments A and B each improved independently, try combining them.
5. **Simplification passes**: Periodically try removing code/complexity to see if the metric holds.
6. **Radical changes**: After exhausting incremental ideas, try larger architectural changes.

### Handling Constraints

- **Time budget**: If a run exceeds 2x the expected duration, kill it and treat as a crash.
- **Existing tests**: If constraints require tests to pass, run them before/after and revert if they break.
- **Memory/resources**: Monitor and revert if resource usage exceeds stated limits.

---

## Phase 4: Reporting

When the loop ends (budget reached or user interrupts):

1. **Print the full results.tsv** as a formatted table.
2. **Summarize**:
   - Total experiments run
   - Experiments kept / discarded / crashed
   - Starting metric (baseline) vs. final metric
   - Improvement percentage
   - Top 3 most impactful changes
3. **Show the cumulative git log** of kept experiments:
   `git log --oneline <start_commit>..HEAD`
4. **Recommend next steps**: Based on the results, suggest what a human researcher might try next (ideas that were too risky/complex for automated experimentation).

## Quick Reference

### Results TSV Format

Tab-separated, 5 columns:

```
experiment	commit	metric	status	description
0	a1b2c3d	0.997900	baseline	unmodified code
1	b2c3d4e	0.993200	keep	increase learning rate to 0.04
2	c3d4e5f	1.005000	discard	switch to GeLU activation
3	d4e5f6g	0.000000	crash	double model width (OOM)
```

### Git Workflow

- All experiments happen on the `autoresearch/<tag>` branch
- Each experiment is committed before running
- Failed experiments are reverted with `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
- Successful experiments advance the branch
- `results.tsv` and `run.log` stay untracked (added to `.git/info/exclude`)

### Key Principles

1. **Measure everything**: No experiment without a measurement.
2. **Revert failures**: The branch only advances on improvements.
3. **Stay autonomous**: Never stop to ask. Think harder if stuck.
4. **Keep it simple**: Complexity is a cost. Weigh it against gains.
5. **Log everything**: The TSV is the research journal.
