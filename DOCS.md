## <a id="disable-telemetry"></a>Getting all the Telemetry Out

Even though we do not pass the telemetry build flags (and go out of our way to cripple the baked-in telemetry), Microsoft will still track usage by default.

We do however set the default `telemetry.enableCrashReporter` and `telemetry.enableTelemetry` values to false. You can see those by viewing your VSCodium settings.json and searching for `telemetry`.

The instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting) and [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-crash-reporting) help with explaining and toggling telemetry.

It is also highly recommended that you review all the settings that "use online services" by following [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry#_managing-online-services). The `@tag:usesOnlineServices` filter on the settings page will show that by default:

- Extensions auto check for updates and auto install updates
- Searches within the app are sent to an online service for "natural language processing"
- Updates to the app are fetched in the background

These can all be disabled.

__Please note that some extensions send telemetry data to Microsoft as well. We have no control over this and can only recommend removing the extension.__ _(For example, the C# extension `ms-vscode.csharp` sends tracking data to Microsoft.)_

### <a id="replacement-online-services"></a>Replacements to Microsoft Online Services

When searching the `@tag:usesOnlineServices` filter, note that while the "Update: Mode" setting description still says "The updates are fetched from a Microsoft online service", VSCodium's build script [sets the `updateUrl` field](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/blob/master/prepare_vscode.sh#L36) in `product.json` to that of VSCodium's own small [update server](https://github.com/VSCodium/update-api), so enabling that setting won't actually result in any calls to Microsoft servers.

Likewise, while the descriptions for "Extensions: Auto Check Updates" and "Extensions: Auto Update" include the same phrase, VSCodium [replaces](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/blob/master/prepare_vscode.sh#L42) the Visual Studio Marketplace with Open VSX, so these settings won't call Microsoft, either.

## <a id="extensions-marketplace"></a>Extensions + Marketplace

The `product.json` file is set up to use [open-vsx.org](https://open-vsx.org/) as extension gallery, which has an [adapter](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/wiki/Using-Open-VSX-in-VS-Code) to the Marketplace API used by VS Code. Since that is a rather new project, you will likely miss some extensions you know from the VS Code Marketplace. You have the following options to obtain such missing extensions:

* Ask the extension maintainers to publish to [open-vsx.org](https://open-vsx.org/) in addition to the VS Code Marketplace. The publishing process is documented in the [Open VSX Wiki](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/wiki/Publishing-Extensions).
* Create a pull request to [this repository](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions) to have the [@open-vsx](https://github.com/open-vsx) service account publish the extensions for you.
* Download and [install the vsix files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix).

See [this article](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/open-vsx/) for more information on the motivation behind Open VSX.

### <a id="howto-vscode-marketplace"></a>How to use the VS Code Marketplace

You can switch and use the VS Code marketplace by using the following solutions. However, note that [ this is not legal](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/31168).

With the following environment variables:
- `VSCODE_GALLERY_SERVICE_URL='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery'`
- `VSCODE_GALLERY_CACHE_URL='https://vscode.blob.core.windows.net/gallery/index'`
- `VSCODE_GALLERY_ITEM_URL='https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items'`
- `VSCODE_GALLERY_CONTROL_URL=''`
- `VSCODE_GALLERY_RECOMMENDATIONS_URL=''`

Or by creating a custom `product.json` at the following location:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\VSCodium` or `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\VSCodium`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/VSCodium`
- Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/VSCodium` or `~/.config/VSCodium`

with the content:

```json
{
  "extensionsGallery": {
    "serviceUrl": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery",
    "cacheUrl": "https://vscode.blob.core.windows.net/gallery/index",
    "itemUrl": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items",
    "controlUrl": "",
    "recommendationsUrl": ""
  }
}
```

### <a id="proprietary-debugging-tools"></a>Proprietary Debugging Tools

The debugger provided with Microsoft's [C# extension](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode) as well as the (Windows) debugger provided with their [C++ extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools) are very restrictively licensed to only work with the official Visual Studio Code build. See [this comment in the C# extension repo](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/2491#issuecomment-418811364) and [this comment in the C++ extension repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/21#issuecomment-248349017).

A workaround exists to get debugging working in C# projects, by using Samsung's opensource [netcoredbg](https://github.com/Samsung/netcoredbg) package. See [this comment](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/issues/82#issue-409806641) for instructions on how to set that up.

### <a id="proprietary-extensions"></a>Proprietary Extensions

Like the debuggers mentioned above, some extensions you may find in the marketplace (like the [Remote Development Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview)) only function with the official Visual Studio Code build. You can work around this by adding the extension's internal ID (found on the extension's page) to the `extensionAllowedProposedApi` property of the product.json in your VSCodium installation. For example:

```json
  "extensionAllowedProposedApi": [
    // ...
    "ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack",
    "ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl",
    // ...
  ],
```

In some cases, the above change won't help because the extension is hard-coded to only work with the official Visual Studio Code product.

## <a id="migrating"></a>Migrating from Visual Studio Code to VSCodium

VSCodium (and a freshly cloned copy of vscode built from source) stores its extension files in `~/.vscode-oss`. So if you currently have Visual Studio Code installed, your extensions won't automatically populate. You can reinstall your extensions from the Marketplace in VSCodium, or copy the `extensions` from `~/.vscode/extensions` to `~/.vscode-oss/extensions`.

Visual Studio Code stores its `keybindings.json` and `settings.json` file in these locations:

- __Windows__: `%APPDATA%\Code\User`
- __macOS__: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User`
- __Linux__: `$HOME/.config/Code/User`

You can copy these files to the VSCodium user settings folder:

- __Windows__: `%APPDATA%\VSCodium\User`
- __macOS__: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/VSCodium/User`
- __Linux__: `$HOME/.config/VSCodium/User`

To copy your settings manually:

- In Visual Studio Code, go to Settings (Command+, if on a Mac)
- Click the three dots `...` and choose 'Open settings.json'
- Copy the contents of settings.json into the same place in VSCodium

## <a id="signin-github"></a>Sign in with GitHub

In VSCodium, `Sign in with GitHub` is using a Personal Access Token.<br />
Follow the documentation https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token to create your token.<br />
Select the scopes dependending of the extension which need access to GitHub. (GitLens requires the `repo` scope.)

### Linux

If you are getting the error `Writing login information to the keychain failed with error 'The name org.freedesktop.secrets was not provided by any .service files'.`, you need to install the package `gnome-keyring`.

## <a id="portable"></a>How do I run VSCodium in portable mode?
You can follow the [Portable Mode instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable) from the Visual Studio Code website.
- **Windows** / **Linux** : the instructions can be followed as written.
- **macOS** : portable mode is enabled by the existence of a specially named folder. For Visual Studio Code that folder name is `code-portable-data`. For VSCodium, that folder name is `codium-portable-data`. So to enable portable mode for VSCodium on Mac OS, follow the instructions outlined in the [link above](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable), but create a folder named `codium-portable-data` instead of `code-portable-data`.

## <a id="file-manager"></a>How do I fix the default file manager (Linux)?

In some case, VSCodium becomes the file manager used to open directories (instead of apps like Dolphin or Nautilus).<br />
It's due to that no application was defined as the default file manager and so the system is using the latest capable application.

To set the default app, create the file `~/.config/mimeapps.list` with the content like:
```
[Default Applications]
inode/directory=org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop;
```

You can find your regular file manager with the command:
```
> grep directory /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache
inode/directory=codium.desktop;org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop;
```

## <a id="press-and-hold"></a>How do I press and hold a key and have it repeat in VSCodium (Mac)?

This is a common question for Visual Studio Code and the procedure is slightly different in VSCodium because the `defaults` path is different.

```bash
$ defaults write com.visualstudio.code.oss ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```

## <a id="terminal-support"></a>How do I open VSCodium from the terminal?

For MacOS and Windows:
- Go to the command palette (View | Command Palette...)
- Choose `Shell command: Install 'codium' command in PATH`.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2707340/60140295-18338a00-9766-11e9-8fda-b525b6f15c13.png)

This allows you to open files or directories in VSCodium directly from your terminal:

```bash
~/in-my-project $ codium . # open this directory
~/in-my-project $ codium file.txt # open this file
```

Feel free to alias this command to something easier to type in your shell profile (e.g. `alias code=codium`).

On Linux, when installed with a package manager, `codium` has been installed in your `PATH`.

### <a id="from-linux-targz"></a>From Linux .tar.gz

When the archive `VSCodium-linux-<arch>-<version>.tar.gz` is extracted, the main entry point for VSCodium is `./bin/codium`.
