Config Environments

Config Environments [​](#config-environments)

Config environments select additional files such as `mise.development.toml` and `mise.production.toml`. The base `mise.toml` still loads, and the selected file overrides values at the same directory level.

For variables passed to your application, use [`[env]`](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/). Selecting a mise config environment does not set application variables such as `NODE_ENV` unless you define them.

## Try an environment [​](#try-an-environment)

mise.toml

toml

```
[env]
APP_MODE = "development"
```

mise.production.toml

toml

```
[env]
APP_MODE = "production"
```

sh

```
mise exec -- sh -c 'echo "$APP_MODE"'                # development
mise -E production exec -- sh -c 'echo "$APP_MODE"'  # production
mise -E production config                          # inspect loaded files
```

## Select environments [​](#select-environments)

Select an environment using one of these methods:

- CLI flag: `-E development` or `--env development`
- Environment variable: `MISE_ENV=development`
- `.miserc.toml` file: `env = ["development"]`

mise looks for matching files throughout the configuration hierarchy. Project files use names such as `mise.production.toml`; the global config uses `config.production.toml` in `MISE_CONFIG_DIR`.

Multiple environments can be specified, for example `mise -E ci,test run build`. Within the same directory, the last environment takes precedence. Use `mise -E ci,test config` to inspect the combined selection.

## Setting MISE\_ENV in .miserc.toml [​](#setting-mise-env-in-miserc-toml)

You can set `MISE_ENV` in a `.miserc.toml` file, which is loaded early, before other config files are discovered. This lets you commit your environment configuration to version control:

toml

```
# .miserc.toml
env = ["development"]
```

### Templates in .miserc.toml [​](#templates-in-miserc-toml)

`.miserc.toml` supports [Tera templates](https://mise.jdx.dev/templates.html#miserc-template-support), which is useful for settings like `ceiling_paths` that reference home or XDG directories:

toml

```
# .miserc.toml

# Stop config search at $HOME
ceiling_paths = ["{{ env.HOME }}"]

# Or use the XDG config home variable
ignored_config_paths = ["{{ xdg_config_home }}/mise/shared.toml"]
```

Only OS-level context is available (environment variables, `cwd`, `arch()`, `os()`, etc.); settings from `mise.toml` are not yet loaded at this stage.

File locations searched (in order of precedence):

1. `.miserc.toml` and `.config/miserc.toml` in the current directory and parent directories
2. `~/.config/mise/miserc.toml` (global)
3. `/etc/mise/miserc.toml` (system)

`MISE_ENV` cannot be set in `mise.toml` because it determines which config files are loaded in the first place.

## Local overrides [​](#local-overrides)

mise also looks for "local" files like `mise.local.toml` and `mise.{MISE_ENV}.local.toml` in the current directory and parent directories. These are not intended to be committed to version control (add `mise.local.toml` and `mise.*.local.toml` to your `.gitignore` file).

These files take priority in this order (top overrides bottom):

- `mise.{MISE_ENV}.local.toml`
- `mise.local.toml`
- `mise.{MISE_ENV}.toml`
- `mise.toml`

If `MISE_OVERRIDE_CONFIG_FILENAMES` is set, it is used instead of all of the above.

You can also use paths like `mise/config.{MISE_ENV}.toml` or `.config/mise.{MISE_ENV}.toml`. These follow the order described in [Configuration](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration.html).

## conf.d environments [​](#conf-d-environments)

Migration in progress

Environment-specific `conf.d` filenames are opt-in until mise 2027.8.10. By default, all non-hidden TOML fragments still load unconditionally, including names such as `node.tools.toml`.

Dots in unconditional fragment names are deprecated. Rename them to use hyphens (for example, `node-tools.toml`) before mise 2027.8.10. At that point, the suffix after the first dot will select an environment.

To opt into the new behavior now, set `env_conf_d = true` in any `miserc.toml` file (see the locations listed above) or set `MISE_ENV_CONF_D=true`. Files in `mise/conf.d`, `.mise/conf.d`, and `.config/mise/conf.d` then use the same environment suffixes as other config files:

text

```
mise/conf.d/tools.toml                    # always loaded
mise/conf.d/tools.local.toml              # always loaded, usually gitignored
mise/conf.d/tools.development.toml        # MISE_ENV=development
mise/conf.d/tools.development.local.toml  # MISE_ENV=development, usually gitignored
.mise/conf.d/tools.toml                   # always loaded
.mise/conf.d/tools.local.toml             # always loaded, usually gitignored
.mise/conf.d/tools.development.toml       # MISE_ENV=development
.mise/conf.d/tools.development.local.toml # MISE_ENV=development, usually gitignored
```

Because this setting controls config discovery, it must be set in a `miserc.toml` file or the environment; setting it in `mise.toml` is too late. To keep the old behavior without the deprecation warning during the migration window, set `env_conf_d = false` explicitly.

Use `mise config` to see which files are being used.

The rules for which file is written to are different, because one file ultimately has to be chosen. See the docs for [`mise use`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/use.html) for more information.

## Platform environments [​](#platform-environments)

With the [`auto_env` setting](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#auto_env) enabled, mise automatically treats the following as active config environments, based on the current platform:

| Environment | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `{os_family}` | `unix` (not defined on Windows—use `windows`) |
| `{os}` | `linux`, `macos`, `windows` |
| `{os}-{arch}` | e.g. `linux-x64`, `macos-arm64`, `windows-x64` |

Architectures use mise's remapped names: `x86_64` → `x64` and `aarch64` → `arm64`.

This makes config files like `mise.windows.toml`, `mise.macos-arm64.toml`, or `mise.unix.toml` load automatically and selects matching lockfiles like `mise.windows.lock`. All of the usual config file locations and `.local.toml` variants work.

Platform environments have lower precedence than explicit `MISE_ENV` entries. The full order is (later overrides earlier): `unix` < `{os}` < `{os}-{arch}` < explicit `MISE_ENV` entries.

Platform environments only affect config file discovery and lockfile selection. They are not added to `MISE_ENV` itself: the  template variable and the `MISE_ENV` variable passed to subprocesses and tasks only reflect explicit environments.

### Rollout [​](#rollout)

`auto_env` is currently **disabled by default**. Starting with mise `2027.6.0`, it will be enabled by default; from `2026.12.0` until then, mise warns when it finds a platform-specific config file that would be newly loaded. To control the behavior explicitly:

toml

```
# .miserc.toml
auto_env = false # keep the old behavior and silence the warning
```

Set `auto_env = true` instead to adopt the new behavior now. Alternatively, set `MISE_AUTO_ENV=true` / `MISE_AUTO_ENV=false`. Like `MISE_ENV`, this is an early-init setting: it must be set in `.miserc.toml` or via the environment variable — setting it in `mise.toml` has no effect because config file discovery has already happened by the time `mise.toml` is read.
