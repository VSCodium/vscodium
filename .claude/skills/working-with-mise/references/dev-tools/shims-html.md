Shims

Shims [​](#shims)

There are several ways to load the `mise` context (dev tools, environment variables) into your shell:

- `mise activate` (also called ["mise PATH activation"](#path-activation)), where `mise` updates your `PATH` and other environment variables every time your prompt is displayed.
- [`mise activate --shims`](#mise-activate-shims), which uses shims to load dev tools.
- Using [`mise x|exec`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/exec.html) or [`mise r|run`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/run.html) for ad-hoc commands or tasks (see ["neither shims nor PATH"](#neither-shims-nor-path)).

This page explains the differences between these methods and how to use them. In particular, it will help you decide whether to use shims or `mise activate` in your shell.

## Overview of the `mise` activation methods [​](#overview)

### PATH activation [​](#path-activation)

mise's "PATH" activation method updates environment variables every time the prompt is displayed. In particular, it updates the `PATH` environment variable, which your shell uses to search for the programs it can run.

INFO

For Bash, add `eval "$(mise activate bash)"` to `~/.bashrc`. Run an `echo ... >> ~/.bashrc` setup command in your terminal only once; do not put that append command in the startup file itself.

For example, by default, your `PATH` variable might look like this:

sh

```
echo "$PATH"
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

With [`mise activate`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/activate.html), `mise` automatically adds the required tools to `PATH`.

sh

```
PATH="$HOME/.local/share/mise/installs/python/3.14.7/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
```

In this example, the python `bin` directory was added at the beginning of `PATH`, making it available in the current shell session. When a fuzzy version like `python = "3.14"` or `node = "26"` is active, this path may use the requested-version symlink, such as `~/.local/share/mise/installs/python/3.14/bin`, instead of the fully resolved patch version.

Use shims when a program needs a stable path to a tool, such as an IDE configured with a Python executable. For scripts, `mise exec -- <command>` loads both tools and environment variables explicitly.

### Shims [​](#mise-activate-shims)

WARNING

`mise activate --shims` does not support all the features of `mise activate`.  
 See [shims vs path](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/shims.html#shims-vs-path) for more information.

When using shims, `mise` places small executables (`shims`) in a directory that is included in your `PATH`. You can think of `shims` as symlinks to the mise binary that intercept commands and load the appropriate context.

sh

```
ls -l ~/.local/share/mise/shims/node
# [...] ~/.local/share/mise/shims/node -> ~/.local/bin/mise
```

By default, the shim directory is located at `~/.local/share/mise/shims` (on Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\mise\shims`). When you install a tool (for example, `node`), `mise` adds an entry to the `shims` directory for every binary the tool provides (for example, `~/.local/share/mise/shims/node`).

sh

```
mise use node@24 npm:prettier@3

~/.local/share/mise/shims/node --version
~/.local/share/mise/shims/prettier --version
```

These commands use the versions selected for the current directory. The paths above assume the default Unix data directory. To find shims by command name, add their directory to the existing `PATH`:

sh

```
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/mise/shims:$PATH"
```

Child processes inherit this `PATH`. Independently launched applications, CI jobs, and other shells need their own environment setup; editing one shell's profile does not configure every process on the machine.

## Lazy tools [​](#lazy-tools)

Set `lazy = true` on a tool when it should be installed the first time one of its commands is invoked instead of by a bare `mise install`:

toml

```
[tools]
node = { version = "24", lazy = true }
```

For registry shorthands, mise creates bootstrap shims from the registry's `bins` metadata. Explicit backends and tools that are not in the registry must declare their command names with `lazy_bins`:

toml

```
[tools]
"github:example/acme" = { version = "1.2.3", lazy = true, lazy_bins = ["acme", "acmectl"] }
```

Run `mise reshim` after editing a lazy declaration directly. Commands such as `mise use` that update tool configuration rebuild the shim farm automatically. Invoking a lazy shim installs its configured provider, plus any configured tools that provider [depends](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/#tool-dependencies) on that are not installed yet, and then executes it. Nothing else in the toolset is installed. This is independent of `not_found_auto_install`; an explicit project tool selection is never bypassed by a lower-precedence lazy declaration.

A bare `mise install` skips missing lazy tools. Pass `--include-lazy` to install all configured tools, including lazy declarations, or name one explicitly, such as `mise install node`, to install only that lazy tool immediately. Once installed, normal `mise activate` places the real tool path ahead of the shim farms, so later calls have no shim dispatch overhead. `mise activate --shims` remains project-aware and dispatches every call through mise by design.

Tasks and `mise x` work the same way. `mise run` does not preinstall lazy tools. Instead, whenever the toolset has a lazy declaration, the environment mise builds for a task (and for `mise x` and `mise env`) places the shim farms behind the tool paths if they are not already on PATH, and any missing bootstrap shims are created first. The task installs the tool the first time it runs one of its commands. `mise x -- <command>` installs the provider of a lazy command directly.

TIP

[`mise activate --shims`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/activate.html#flags) is a shorthand for adding the shims directory to PATH.

## How to add mise shims to PATH [​](#how-to-add-mise-shims-to-path)

Use `mise activate --shims` when `mise` itself is already on `PATH`. Add the following lines to the indicated files, preserving existing setup. Bash and Zsh profiles run for **login shells**; they are not startup files for arbitrary non-interactive scripts.

Bash: \~/.bash\_profileBash: \~/.bashrcZsh: \~/.zprofileZsh: \~/.zshrcFish: \~/.config/fish/config.fish

sh

```
# Use ~/.profile instead if that is your existing login startup file.
eval "$(mise activate bash --shims)"
```

sh

```
eval "$(mise activate bash)"
```

sh

```
eval "$(mise activate zsh --shims)"
```

sh

```
eval "$(mise activate zsh)"
```

fish

```
if status is-interactive
    mise activate fish | source
else
    mise activate fish --shims | source
end
```

Bash login shells read the first available file among `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`, and `~/.profile`. They read `~/.bashrc` only if the profile sources it. Check your existing startup files before adding a new profile that would hide the old one. Zsh reads `~/.zprofile` for login shells and `~/.zshrc` for interactive shells.

For a script or CI command, prefer `mise exec -- <command>`. A script launched from an already configured shell inherits its `PATH`, but a scheduler or IDE may not inherit that shell's environment. See [IDE integration](https://mise.jdx.dev/ide-integration.html) and [Windows setup](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html#windows-scoop) for those environments.

INFO

It's fine to call [`mise activate --shims`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/activate.html#flags) in your shell profile file and then later call [`mise activate`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/activate.html) in an interactive session. PATH activation keeps the user and existing system shim farms behind real tool paths when the effective toolset contains a lazy declaration or `not_found_auto_install` is enabled. Without either, full activation removes the shim farms as before. This makes lazy bootstrap commands available without adding dispatch overhead after installation. `not_found_auto_install` still controls general missing-tool installation, but does not disable an explicit `lazy = true` declaration.

To explicitly keep tool shims out of full shell activation, including when auto-install or lazy tools are enabled, run `mise settings set activate_shims false` and restart your shell. See [`activate_shims`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#activate_shims) for the tradeoffs. Shims serve several purposes: installing missing configured versions, bootstrapping lazy tools, and dispatching configured command wrappers. Wrappers such as `cargo` through [mr-boxington](https://github.com/jdx/mr-boxington) use their own `command-wrappers/bin` directory, which remains active with this setting disabled. Explicit `mise activate --shims` also continues to work.

INFO

When a shim cannot resolve a mise-managed tool (for example, a version pinned in `mise.toml` that hasn't been installed and [`not_found_auto_install`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#not_found_auto_install) is disabled), it falls back to the first same-named executable found elsewhere on `PATH` rather than erroring. This is convenient for tools you also want available outside of mise, but for a tool the OS also ships (`python3` on Debian/Ubuntu, for example) it means the shim can silently run a completely different, unrelated binary instead of failing loudly.

Set [`not_found_system_fallback`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#not_found_system_fallback) to `false`, alongside `not_found_auto_install = false`, if you'd rather an unresolvable shim fail outright.

### Excluding command names [​](#excluding-command-names)

Some commands are also provided by the OS, and other software on the machine depends on getting the system one. [`shims.exclude`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#shims.exclude) keeps those names out of the shim directory — mise still installs and manages the tool, it just never generates a shim for that name:

toml

```
[settings.shims]
exclude = ["python", "python3", "pip", "pip3"]
```

On Arch Linux, for example, `/usr/bin/python` is the distro interpreter and its modules live in a matching `site-packages` directory. Without this setting, entering a project that pins `python` changes which interpreter a `#!/usr/bin/env python` script gets, and a `PKGBUILD` that calls `python` during a build picks up the pinned version rather than the system one.

Excluded names are removed from the shim directory on the next `mise reshim`, and are skipped by the other shim producers too: lazy-tool bootstrap shims and plugin-provided shims. Version-qualified shims are unaffected, so `python3.12` still resolves to whatever version a config selects. Because no shim exists, mise is out of that command's execution path and no longer loads configuration on each invocation of it.

WARNING

Excluding `python3` means `python3 -m venv` builds a virtualenv from the system interpreter rather than the configured one, silently. Use the version-qualified command (`python3.12 -m venv`) when you want the mise-managed version.

This setting only affects generated shims. Under `mise activate` without `--shims`, a tool's `bin` directory joins `PATH` as a whole, so excluded names remain visible there.

- You can also decide to use only `shims` if you prefer, though this comes with some [limitations](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/shims.html#shims-vs-path).
- An alternative to [`mise activate --shims`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/activate.html#flags) is to use `export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/mise/shims:$PATH"`. This can be helpful if `mise` is not yet available at that point.

### mise reshim [​](#mise-reshim)

To force `mise` to update the contents of the `shims` directory, run `mise reshim`.

Use `mise reshim --system` for the system shim farm. If `shims_dir` and `system_shims_dir` resolve to the same physical path, either command reconciles one combined farm containing both scopes.

mise rebuilds shims when it installs, updates, or removes a tool. If another package manager adds executables inside an existing installation, run `mise reshim`. The Node.js core plugin can do this after `npm install -g` through its [`node.npm_shim`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#node.npm_shim) wrapper; this is not a general hook for every package manager.

`mise reshim` only creates and removes shims. Some users treat it as a "fix it" button, but it is only necessary when `~/.local/share/mise/shims` doesn't contain something it should.

For `mise reshim`, the configured shim directory may be a shared executable directory such as `~/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`: reshim only replaces or removes entries it recognizes as mise shims, and leaves a same-named unmanaged file in place. Other mise features still identify shim directories as whole `PATH` entries, however, so a shared directory is not yet supported with `mise activate`, hook-env, or internal dependency lookups. Use a dedicated `shims_dir` if you use those features.

## Command wrappers [​](#command-wrappers)

Use `[wrappers]` when a command should always pass through another program while keeping its ordinary name. For example, this routes every `cargo` invocation through [Mr Boxington](https://github.com/jdx/mr-boxington):

toml

```
[tools]
mr-boxington = "1.4.1"

[wrappers.cargo]
command = "mbx"
env = { MBX_CARGO_SHIM_MODE = "1" }
```

Run `mise reshim` after adding or removing a wrapper. The wrapper is available with both `mise activate` and `mise activate --shims`, and takes precedence over an executable with the same name. When it delegates, mise removes its dispatch directories from `PATH`, so `mbx` resolves Cargo from mise-managed Rust when configured and otherwise falls through to rustup or the system installation.

A short form is available when no arguments or environment variables are needed:

toml

```
[wrappers]
terraform = "tofu"
```

The detailed form can insert arguments before those supplied by the user:

toml

```
[wrappers.python]
command = "uv"
args = ["run", "python"]
```

## Shims vs PATH [​](#shims-vs-path)

The following features are affected when shims are used **instead** of [PATH activation](#path-activation):

- [Env vars](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/) defined in mise are only available to mise tools
- Most [hooks](https://mise.jdx.dev/hooks.html) won't trigger
- The Unix `which` command points to the shim, obscuring the real executable

In general, PATH activation (`mise activate`) is recommended over shims for *interactive* situations.

With `activate`, every time the prompt is displayed, mise determines what `PATH` and other env vars should be and exports them. This is why it doesn't work well for non-interactive situations like scripts: the prompt is never displayed, so you have to call `mise hook-env` manually to get mise to update the env vars (though there are exceptions; see [hook on `cd`](#hook-on-cd)).

### Env vars and shims [​](#env-vars-and-shims)

A downside of shims is that environment variables are only loaded when a shim is called. This means that if you set an [environment variable](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/) in `mise.toml`, it is only applied when a shim is called.

The following example only works under `mise activate`:

sh

```
$ mise set NODE_ENV=production
$ echo $NODE_ENV
production
```

But this works with either:

sh

```
$ mise set NODE_ENV=production
$ node -p process.env.NODE_ENV
production
```

You can also use [`mise x|exec`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/exec.html) and [`mise r|run`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/run.html) to load the environment even if you don't need any mise tools:

sh

```
$ mise set NODE_ENV=production
$ mise x -- bash -c "echo \$NODE_ENV"
production
$ mise r some_task_that_uses_NODE_ENV
production
```

TIP

In general, [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) are a good way to ensure that the mise environment is always loaded.

### Hooks and shims [​](#hooks-and-shims)

The [hooks](https://mise.jdx.dev/hooks.html) `cd`, `enter`, and `leave` only trigger with `mise activate`. The separate [`watch_files`](https://mise.jdx.dev/hooks.html#watch-files-hook) configuration also requires `mise activate`. However, `preinstall` and `postinstall` still work with shims because they don't require shell integration.

### `which` [​](#which)

Many users find `which` valuable. Shims effectively "break" `which`, causing it to show the location of the shim. A workaround is `mise which`, which shows the actual location. Some users prefer the "cleanliness" of running `which node` and getting back a real path with a version number in it, e.g.:

sh

```
$ which node
~/.local/share/mise/installs/node/24/bin/node
```

### Performance [​](#performance)

PATH activation does its work at prompts and supported directory-change hooks. Shims resolve the environment when a command is invoked. Which costs less depends on how you run commands.

For example, a script that repeatedly calls a shim resolves the environment on each call:

bash

```
for i in {1..500}; do
    node script.js
done
```

Run the enclosing script with `mise exec -- bash benchmark.sh` to prepare the environment once. Child processes then inherit the real tool directories ahead of the shim directory. Similarly, a process launched by a shim passes the resolved environment to its children.

See [slow shell prompts](https://mise.jdx.dev/troubleshooting.html#slow-shell-prompts) to diagnose activation overhead. Hook behavior and parent-shell environment updates also differ, so choose an activation method based on those requirements as well as performance.

## Neither shims nor PATH [​](#neither-shims-nor-path)

[`mise exec`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/exec.html), [`mise run`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/run.html), and [`mise en`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/en.html) load tools and environment variables explicitly:

sh

```
mise exec -- node --version
mise run build
```

The second command requires a task named `build`. This approach works for CI, scripts, and projects where you do not want to change shell startup files. It requires `mise` on `PATH`, but no shell activation or shim directory.

## Hook on `cd` [​](#hook-on-cd)

For some shells (`bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `xonsh`), `mise` hooks into the `cd` command, while in others, it only runs when the prompt is displayed. This relies on `chpwd` in `zsh`, a `chpwd` emulation (wrapping `cd`/`pushd`/`popd`) plus `PROMPT_COMMAND` in `bash`, `fish_prompt` in `fish`, and `on_chdir` in `xonsh`.

Directory-change hooks let those shells apply the new project environment before the next command, even if no prompt has appeared yet.

<details>

<summary>Running several commands in a single line</summary>



If you run a set of commands in a single line like the following:

sh

```
cd ~
cd ~/src/proj1 && node -v && cd ~/src/proj2 && node -v
```

With <code>mise activate</code> in a shell without a <code>cd</code> hook, this uses the tools from <code>~</code>, not from <code>~/src/proj1</code> or <code>~/src/proj2</code>, even after the directory changes.

This is because in these shells <code>mise</code> runs just before your prompt is displayed, whereas in others it hooks into <code>cd</code>. Shims *will* always work with the inline example above.

</details>

## Using mise in rc files [​](#using-mise-in-rc-files)

rc files like `.zshrc` are unusual: they are scripts, but they run only for interactive sessions. If you need to access tools provided by mise inside an rc file, you have two options:

hook-envshims

sh

```
eval "$(mise activate zsh)"
eval "$(mise hook-env -s zsh)"
node some_script.js
```

sh

```
eval "$(mise activate zsh --shims)" # should be first
eval "$(mise activate zsh)"
node some_script.js
```
