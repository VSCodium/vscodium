Packslip Man Pages, Completions, and Skills

Packslip Man Pages, Completions, and Skills [​](#packslip-man-pages-completions-and-skills)

Tools installed with the [Packslip backend](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/packslip.html) can provide man pages, shell completions, and agent skills that match the version active in your project. The publisher declares these resources in the release manifest.

Install the tool through `packslip:` to use its declared resources. An existing installation from another backend does not acquire them automatically.

## Completions [​](#completions)

mise supports tool completions for zsh, bash, fish, and PowerShell. The installed completion file follows the tool version active in each project, so you do not need to reinstall completions after changing versions.

### Use completions [​](#use-completions)

With [mise activated](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#activate-mise), completions become available when an installed tool is active in your project. For example:

sh

```
mise use packslip:github.com/jdx/hk
```

Run `mise exec -- hk --version` to verify the installation, then type `hk` and press Tab in an activated shell. hk publishes native completion scripts for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell, so no extra setup command or `usage` installation is needed. mise registers a loader in the shell; it reads the publisher's script only when you complete a command. Switching projects or tool versions selects the matching completion, and leaving the project removes its registration.

### Manual setup without shell activation [​](#manual-setup-without-shell-activation)

For tools that declare completions in their Packslip manifest, mise can install a completion file that loads those resources. Replace `TOOL` below with the executable's name:

| Shell | Command |
| --- | --- |
| zsh | `mise completion zsh --tool TOOL --install` |
| bash | `mise completion bash --tool TOOL --install` |
| fish | `mise completion fish --tool TOOL --install` |
| PowerShell | `mise completion powershell --tool TOOL --install` |

Follow any one-time setup instructions printed by the command, then load the completion file or start a new shell. mise writes the completion file but does not edit your shell configuration. It preserves an existing file it did not create unless you pass `--force`.

To print a completion script without installing it, omit `--install`:

sh

```
mise completion zsh --tool TOOL
```

`--tool` takes the command name, not a backend identifier such as `packslip:github.com/jdx/hk`. If a release contains several commands, choose the one you want to complete. Without `--tool`, `mise completion` generates completions for mise itself.

## Man pages [​](#man-pages)

When an installed tool's Packslip manifest declares a static `man` resource, mise adds it to `MANPATH` while that tool version is active. This works in an activated shell and in environments created by `mise exec`, `mise run`, and `mise env`. Switching projects selects the matching version's pages.

mise keeps these pages below `.mise-packslip/man` in the tool's installation. It prepends that directory to an existing `MANPATH`; when `MANPATH` was unset, mise retains the operating system's default manual-page locations. A tool installed with an older mise version must be reinstalled once so mise can prepare this layout.

Packslip man pages can come from the release archive, a separately signed release asset, or the source repository at the release commit. A file such as `tool.1` is placed under `man1`; compressed pages such as `tool.5.gz` are also supported. Generated `exec` resources and man pages derived only from a `cli-spec` are not installed automatically.

### Generated completions [​](#generated-completions)

A publisher can provide a completion file, a static usage CLI specification, or a command that generates either one. mise prefers static sources. A usage-derived completion uses the engine embedded in mise; you do not need to install `usage` separately.

If a completion needs a publisher's generator command, mise runs it on demand and caches successful output for the installed version, executable, and shell. This can happen during tab completion or a direct `mise completion --tool` invocation. It does not run the publisher's tool merely at shell startup.

INFO

[`packslip.exec`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#packslip.exec) controls resource generation **during installation**. Setting it to `false` does not disable **on-demand completion generation**.

## Skills [​](#skills)

A skill is a directory containing `SKILL.md` and any supporting files. mise fetches declared skills during tool installation by default, so different tool versions can carry different skill content. Use `mise skills ls` to inspect the skills fetched for active tools; a tool without declared skills has none to synchronize.

Inspect skills from the tools active in your project:

sh

```
mise skills ls
mise skills ls --json
```

Link them where your agent reads skills:

sh

```
mise skills sync --dir .agents/skills
```

These are local symlinks, not portable copies of the skill. Keep generated links out of version control and have each developer run sync on their own machine. The directory can also contain handwritten skills; mise preserves those.

Each link points into the active tool version's install directory. Run sync after a version change to update the links. mise preserves user-created directories and unrelated links, reporting any conflicting names as skipped.

### When a declared skill is not installed [​](#when-a-declared-skill-is-not-installed)

`mise skills ls` and `mise skills sync` report a skill a packslip declares that is not in the install, by name and with the reason: [`skills.fetch`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#skills.fetch) is off, the skill is generated by an `exec` command and [`packslip.exec`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#packslip.exec) is off, or the download failed at install time and reinstalling the tool will fetch it.

### Choose a skill directory [​](#choose-a-skill-directory)

Without `--dir`, sync uses `.claude/skills` under the nearest mise project root. Set [`skills.dir`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#skills.dir) to use your agent's preferred directory. `--dir` overrides the setting for one invocation.

`mise skills sync --global` resolves the configured directory under your home folder instead; with the default setting, that is `~/.claude/skills`. An absolute directory is used as written.

### Keep project links up to date [​](#keep-project-links-up-to-date)

Configure the skill directory and enable synchronization after `mise install` and `mise use`:

toml

```
[settings.skills]
dir = ".agents/skills"
auto_sync = true
prune = true
```

`prune = true` removes mise-owned links for skills no longer active. Without it, stale links remain. To prune on one manual run:

sh

```
mise skills sync --dir .agents/skills --prune
```

The configuration above belongs in the project's `mise.toml` or your global settings, depending on where you want it to apply.

Automatic sync requires a mise project root. It does not run just because you change directories. Reload skills in your agent if it does not detect changes automatically.

### Choose whether to fetch or generate skills [​](#choose-whether-to-fetch-or-generate-skills)

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`skills.fetch`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#skills.fetch) | `true` | Fetch declared skills during tool installation. |
| [`skills.dir`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#skills.dir) | `.claude/skills` | Choose the directory used by sync. |
| [`skills.auto_sync`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#skills.auto_sync) | `false` | Sync after install and use within a mise project. |
| [`skills.prune`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#skills.prune) | `false` | Remove stale mise-owned links during sync. |
| [`packslip.exec`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#packslip.exec) | `false` | Run the installed tool to generate a resource during installation. |

A skill can come from the artifact, a separate signed asset, or the source repository at the release commit. Fetching these files does not execute the tool. A skill provided only through an `exec` command is generated during installation when `packslip.exec` is enabled. That command runs the newly installed executable and must print `SKILL.md` content.

Turning off `skills.fetch` skips future fetching; it does not delete previously fetched files or existing links. Use sync with pruning to remove links to skills that are no longer active.

## Resource selection and command execution [​](#resource-selection-and-command-execution)

The following details apply when a release offers multiple sources for a resource.

### Source selection [​](#source-selection)

Resources can target an exact artifact filename or a platform. mise selects resources for the artifact it installed, preferring an exact artifact match, then the most specific platform match. Different executables, shells, and skill names identify separate resources.

For equally specific alternatives, mise prefers a file inside the artifact, then a separate signed asset, then a source-repository file. Static CLI specs follow the same ordering. Declaration order breaks ties within a source type. A usable higher-priority skill source prevents fetching or running lower ones. A directory counts as a skill only when `SKILL.md` is present.

For completions, mise first tries a supplied completion file, then a static usage CLI spec, then a command that generates a completion or CLI spec. Selection is specific to the installed artifact, executable, and shell.

Separate resource assets must match their signed digests; repository resources are pinned to the release's source commit. A missing optional resource can leave the tool installed without it. A digest mismatch is a verification failure.

### Generation and caching [​](#generation-and-caching)

Concurrent requests for the same generated completion share the work. Empty output, a failure, or a timeout is not cached; mise tries the next source. Static completion files are read directly from the installation without writing a cache, so they also work from read-only or shared installs.

When mise runs a resource generator, it:

- Adds the installed executables to PATH and applies the manifest's environment variables, expanding `{shell}` for completion resources.
- Uses a temporary working directory, no stdin, and discarded stderr.
- Enforces a five-second deadline and a 4 MiB output limit, and cleans up child processes after completion, failure, timeout, or cancellation.

These limits do not sandbox the executable. The [backend verification checks](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/packslip.html#what-is-verified) establish which publisher's executable is being used.

### How completion files follow the active version [​](#follow-the-active-version)

The installed completion file delegates to mise when you complete a command. After you change directories or select another version with `mise use`, the next completion uses that directory's active version.

| Shell | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| zsh | Temporarily delegates to the publisher's script, then restores mise's completion function. |
| bash | Delegates to the publisher's registration and restores mise's function at the next prompt. |
| fish | Loads the publisher's script in a child shell for each completion, keeping registrations out of the parent shell. |
| PowerShell | Temporarily delegates to the publisher's completer, then restores mise's completer. |

## Troubleshooting [​](#troubleshooting)

| Symptom | Next step |
| --- | --- |
| Tool was installed through another backend | Check `mise ls`, then use an explicit `packslip:` identifier to install a release that declares the resource. |
| No completion declared | Confirm the release supports your shell and executable. If it does not, the publisher must add a completion or CLI spec. |
| `--install` rejects a tool identifier | Pass the executable name, such as `hk`, rather than `packslip:github.com/jdx/hk`. |
| A completion file already exists | Inspect the existing file before choosing to replace it with `--force`. |
| Script prints but tab completion does not work | Check that mise is activated and the tool is active in this project. With manual setup, follow the instructions printed by `--install`. Mise handles usage-derived completions itself. |
| Completion generation fails | Check that the publisher's command produces nonempty output within the time and size limits. Report a failing generator to the publisher. |
| No skills listed | Check `mise skills ls`, the active version, and whether its manifest declares skills. Check `skills.fetch`; an exec-only skill also needs `packslip.exec` enabled during installation. |
| A skill link is skipped | Inspect the conflicting path; mise preserves user-owned files and directories. |
| Links point to an old version | Run `mise skills sync`, or enable `skills.auto_sync` for future install/use operations. |

For exact flags, see [`mise completion`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/completion.html), [`mise skills ls`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/skills/ls.html), and [`mise skills sync`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/skills/sync.html). Publishers can follow the [Packslip resources guide](https://packslip.dev/docs/resources/) to add these declarations to their releases.
