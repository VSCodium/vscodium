mise oci

mise oci experimental [​](#mise-oci)

`mise oci build` turns a `mise.toml` into a container image, with one [OCI](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) layer per installed tool.

Tool layers can be reused independently when a version changes. Image config, manifests, and layers whose inputs changed still need updating; a Python change can also invalidate dependent pipx layers.

Build on a **Linux host with the target architecture**. mise packages the installed host binaries; it does not cross-compile or download another OS's tools for the image. `mise oci run` also requires Docker or Podman. Building and pushing an OCI layout use mise's own image and registry support.

Experimental

`mise oci build` is experimental. Enable it with:

sh

```
mise settings set experimental=true
# or, per-invocation:
MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1 mise oci build …
```

Flags, output layout, and defaults may change in future releases.

## Commands at a glance [​](#commands-at-a-glance)

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `mise oci build` | Produce an OCI image layout on disk. |
| `mise oci run` | Build (or reuse) an image and run a command inside it via podman/docker. |
| `mise oci push` | Build (or reuse) an image and push it to a registry. |

## Quick start [​](#quick-start)

On Linux, start with a project configuration such as:

mise.toml

toml

```
[settings]
experimental = true

[tools]
node = "24"
```

Build a local image layout, then verify its executable through a container engine:

sh

```
mise oci build -o ./mise-oci
mise oci run --image-dir ./mise-oci -- node --version
```

The default base is `debian:bookworm-slim`. Add the generated `mise-oci/` directory to `.gitignore`. This creates a tool environment; it does not automatically copy your application or install its package dependencies. Use a volume for development or [`oci.copy`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/mise-oci.html#oci-section-in-mise-toml) for files that belong in the image.

To inspect the layout with an external tool, install `skopeo` and run `skopeo inspect oci:./mise-oci`. To publish it, follow [push authentication](#push-authentication) and choose a registry/repository you can write to:

sh

```
mise oci push --image-dir ./mise-oci ghcr.io/OWNER/IMAGE:TAG
```

Replace the uppercase placeholders. This command publishes the image to that registry; it is separate from the local build and run checks.

## How layering works [​](#how-layering-works)

Given this `mise.toml`:

toml

```
[tools]
node = "20"
python = "3.12"
jq = "1.8.1"
```

`mise oci build` produces layers roughly like this:

1. **Base image layers** (e.g. `debian:bookworm-slim`) — copied through from the registry unchanged, so registry dedup kicks in.
2. **mise binary** at `/usr/local/bin/mise` (skip with `--no-mise`).
3. **Configured apt or apk `[bootstrap.packages]`**, if any, installed into the base rootfs and emitted as one package layer.
4. **One layer per tool**, each rooted at `/mise/installs/<plugin>/<version>/`. Annotated with `dev.mise.tool.short` and `dev.mise.tool.version`.
5. **Configured `[dotfiles]`**, if any, baked as image files.
6. **Synthesized `/etc/mise/config.toml`** referencing `/mise` as the data directory.

Changing Node.js leaves unrelated tool archives reusable. The generated configuration and image manifest still reflect the new version. Reuse also depends on the in-image path, file ownership, and any relocation inputs.

## `mise oci build` [​](#mise-oci-build)

sh

```
mise oci build [-o PATH] [--from REF] [--tag REF] [--mount-point PATH]
               [--copy HOST_PATH:IMAGE_PATH]...
               [--no-mise] [--owner UID[:GID]]
```

- `-o, --output PATH` — output directory (default `./mise-oci`)
- `--from REF` — base image reference (overrides `[oci].from` and the `oci.default_from` setting). Use `scratch` to build without a base.
- `-t, --tag REF` — tag written to `index.json` as the `org.opencontainers.image.ref.name` annotation
- `--mount-point PATH` — where mise installs live inside the image (default `/mise`). Must be absolute.
- `--copy HOST_PATH:IMAGE_PATH` — copy a host file or directory to an absolute path in the image. Repeat the flag for multiple payloads. Each payload is emitted as an independent, content-addressed layer after the tool layers.
- `--no-mise` — don't embed the running mise binary at `/usr/local/bin/mise`
- `--owner UID[:GID]` — numeric owner for every generated layer entry. Defaults to `[oci].user_id` / `[oci].group_id`, then `0:0`. If GID is omitted, it defaults to UID. This affects file ownership only, not the image `USER` directive.

## `mise oci run` [​](#mise-oci-run)

Build (or reuse) an image and run a command inside it, like `docker run` / `podman run`. Stdin/stdout/stderr are inherited.

sh

```
mise oci run [--engine ENGINE] [--image-dir DIR]
             [--from REF] [--mount-point PATH] [--no-mise]
             [--owner UID[:GID]]
             [-i] [-t] [-e KEY=VAL]... [--volume HOST:CONTAINER]...
             [-w DIR] [--keep]
             -- <cmd> [args...]
```

- `--engine` — `auto` (default, prefers podman), `podman`, or `docker`.
- `--image-dir` — skip the build and use an existing OCI layout.
- `--owner UID[:GID]` — numeric owner for generated layer entries when building fresh; it cannot be combined with `--image-dir`.
- `-i`, `-t`, `-e`, `--volume`, `-w`, `--keep` — pass through to the underlying engine the same way `docker run` uses them. (There's no `-v` short flag for `--volume` because mise reserves `-v` for `--verbose`; use `--volume` or `--mount`.)

Examples:

sh

```
# Interactive shell
mise oci run -it -- bash

# One-shot command with env + volume
mise oci run -e DEBUG=1 --volume "$PWD:/work" -w /work -- npm test

# Re-use a previously built layout
mise oci build -o ./img
mise oci run --image-dir ./img -- node --version
```

**Requirements:** either `podman` (native OCI-layout support) or `docker` (mise streams the image into the daemon via `docker load`).

## `mise oci push` [​](#mise-oci-push)

Build (or reuse) an image and push it to a registry with mise's built-in registry client — no skopeo, crane, or docker daemon required. Only blobs the registry doesn't already have are uploaded, so repeat pushes of a mostly-unchanged toolset transfer very little. When the base image lives on the destination registry, its blobs are cross-repository mounted instead of re-uploaded (no bytes transferred). Large layers upload in chunks with progress bars, and transient network failures are retried with backoff (`http_retries` controls attempts).

### Layer reuse [​](#layer-reuse)

`oci build`, `oci run`, and `oci push` share a local cache of packaged tool layers. An unchanged tool only needs to be tarred and gzipped once, even when building separate images or using different output directories. Concurrent builds coordinate per cache entry, and each output layout receives its own complete copy of the locally cached layer.

Local reuse hashes the files and their image paths, executable permissions, symlink targets, ownership, and relocated contents. Editing or reinstalling a tool invalidates its cache when the packaged content changes, even if the version, file size, and modification time stay the same. Cache hits still read and hash the installation; they avoid tar construction and gzip compression. The base image is not part of a tool layer's cache key.

Pass `oci build --no-cache` or `oci push --no-cache` to bypass the local cache. `mise cache clear TOOL` removes that tool's cached layers; `mise cache clear` removes all cached layers. Cache entries live in the normal mise tool cache, so CI jobs can preserve them along with `MISE_CACHE_DIR`.

When pushing an image whose base lives in the **same repository** as the destination, mise fetches the current base manifest and config but leaves its layer blobs in the registry. Mutable base tags are resolved on every push. This avoids downloading base layers that the destination already contains, including when using `--cache-from` or `--no-cache`. Builds that install `[bootstrap.packages]` still download the base layers to unpack the filesystem; `oci build` and `oci run` also download them to produce complete local images.

Tool layers whose cache key (tool, version, in-image prefix, and file owner) matches the previously pushed image are **reused from the registry instead of rebuilt** — skipping the tar/gzip work entirely. Reused tools don't even need to be installed locally, which makes CI pushes fast: only tools whose version actually changed get installed and packaged.

- By default the cache is the destination ref itself (the image previously pushed under that tag).
- `--cache-from REF` reuses layers from another tag in the **same repository** — useful when every push gets a unique tag:sh

  ```
  mise oci push --cache-from ghcr.io/me/dev:latest ghcr.io/me/dev:$GIT_SHA
  ```


- `--no-cache` disables remote and local tool-layer reuse and rebuilds from local installs (docker-style escape hatch — reuse trusts that the registry's layer content matches its annotations, rather than rebuilding the exact bytes locally).

One caveat: environment derivation (`JAVA_HOME`-style `exec_env` vars) runs against local installs. For a reused tool that isn't installed, most backends still derive paths correctly, but exotic backends may contribute incomplete env — pass `--no-cache` (with the tool installed) if the image config looks wrong.

sh

```
mise oci push [--image-dir DIR]
              [--from REF] [--mount-point PATH] [--no-mise]
              [--owner UID[:GID]]
              <REGISTRY_REF>
```

- `<REGISTRY_REF>` — fully-qualified destination (e.g. `ghcr.io/me/devenv:latest`). Must include a registry host. Loopback registries ( `localhost:5000/…`) are contacted over plain HTTP, the same insecure-by-default convention docker applies. Non-loopback plain-HTTP registries (a homelab `registry.lan:5000`) must be opted in via the `oci.insecure_registries` setting:toml

  ```
  [settings.oci]
  insecure_registries = ["registry.lan:5000"]
  ```


- `--image-dir` — push an existing OCI layout instead of building.
- `--owner UID[:GID]` — numeric owner for generated layer entries when building fresh; it cannot be combined with `--image-dir`.

Examples:

sh

```
# Build + push in one shot
mise oci push ghcr.io/me/devenv:latest

# Push an image built earlier
mise oci build -o ./img
mise oci push --image-dir ./img ghcr.io/me/devenv:v1
```

### Push authentication [​](#push-authentication)

Credentials are resolved from the same sources docker and podman use, in this order:

1. `$REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE`
2. `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json` (podman)
3. `~/.config/containers/auth.json`
4. `~/.docker/config.json` (or `$DOCKER_CONFIG/config.json`)

Both inline `auths` entries and credential helpers (`credsStore` / `credHelpers`, e.g. `docker-credential-osxkeychain`, `docker-credential-ecr-login`) are supported — so a plain `docker login ghcr.io` or `podman login ghcr.io` is all the setup needed. When no credentials are found, mise pushes anonymously (useful for local registries) and warns.

For ghcr.io, the token needs the `write:packages` scope.

### `[oci]` section in `mise.toml` [​](#oci-section-in-mise-toml)

toml

```
[oci]
from        = "debian:bookworm-slim"  # base image ref
tag         = "ghcr.io/me/devenv:v1"  # default tag for the built image
workdir     = "/workspace"             # WORKDIR
entrypoint  = []           # ENTRYPOINT
cmd         = []                        # CMD
user        = "1000:1000"                # USER
user_id     = 1000                      # tar layer entry UID (file ownership)
group_id    = 1000                      # tar layer entry GID (defaults to user_id)
mount_point = "/mise"                  # where tools install in the image

[[oci.copy]]
host  = "dist/my-app"
image = "/usr/local/bin/my-app"

[[oci.copy]]
host  = "assets"
image = "/srv/app/assets"

# Extra env baked into the image config (image-only — won't shadow MISE_*).
[oci.env]
NODE_ENV = "production"

# Labels baked into the image config.
[oci.labels]
"org.opencontainers.image.source" = "https://github.com/me/my-app"
```

The copy examples require `dist/my-app` and `assets` to exist. `[oci].user` sets the image `USER` directive; it does not create an account, home directory, or writable workspace. Use a numeric UID/GID or a user already provided by the base image. `[oci].user_id` and `[oci].group_id` set layer file ownership; if no `group_id` is configured, it defaults to the resolved `user_id`.

CLI flags override the `[oci]` section. The `[oci]` section overrides the `oci.default_from` / `oci.default_mount_point` settings.

When `mise.toml` files are layered (global + project), sections are merged field-by-field with the more specific file winning per field.

Copy sources may be files, directories, or symlinks. Directory contents land at `image`; the source directory name is not added. Image paths must be absolute and may not contain `.` or `..` components. Parent directories are created automatically, executable bits are preserved, and ownership follows `--owner` or `[oci].user_id` / `[oci].group_id`. Copy layers are annotated with `dev.mise.copy=<image path>` so they can be identified during inspection. Relative `host` paths in `[[oci.copy]]` resolve from the directory containing the config file that declares them; relative CLI paths resolve from the current working directory. When layered configs copy to the same image path, less-specific entries are emitted first so the most-specific config wins. CLI copies are emitted last.

### `[bootstrap]` and `[dotfiles]` in OCI images [​](#bootstrap-and-dotfiles-in-oci-images)

`mise oci build` applies project-scoped `[bootstrap.packages]` and `[dotfiles]` entries to the image. This is the OCI equivalent of the declarative package and dotfile parts of `mise bootstrap`. Pass `--include-global` to also include `[bootstrap.packages]` and `[dotfiles]` from global configs.

toml

```
[bootstrap.packages]
"apt:curl" = "latest"

[dotfiles]
"/etc/profile.d/project.sh" = { source = "profile.sh", mode = "copy" }
"~/.config/app/config.toml" = { source = "config.toml", mode = "template" }
```

For packages, OCI builds support `apt:` entries with a Debian/Ubuntu base image and `apk:` entries with an Alpine/Wolfi base image. mise unpacks the base image into a temporary rootfs, calls the matching host package manager to install into that rootfs, then emits the filesystem changes as one OCI layer annotated with `dev.mise.system.packages=apt` or `dev.mise.system.packages=apk`. A build may use only the package manager matching its base image; mixing `apt:` and `apk:` entries is rejected.

The host must provide `apt-get` and `dpkg` for apt layers, or `apk` for apk layers. Apk package scripts execute inside a chroot, so apk layers currently require a Linux host running mise as root. `--no-cache` is passed to apk and transient package-manager cache and log files are removed before the layer is created.

For image builds, `symlink` and `symlink-each` entries are copied as file content. Host symlinks would usually point back to the checkout path and be broken inside the container, so the image receives the resolved contents instead. Targets beginning with `~/` are written under `/root/`.

`[bootstrap.macos.defaults]` and the imperative `bootstrap` task are not run by `mise oci build`. macOS defaults do not apply to Linux OCI images, and container-specific startup work belongs in the image entrypoint or command.

### Settings [​](#settings)

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oci.default_from` | `debian:bookworm-slim` | Default base image when none is specified. |
| `oci.default_mount_point` | `/mise` | Where tools install inside the image. |

Choose a base compatible with the packaged binaries and their shared libraries. The default uses glibc. An Alpine/musl base requires musl-compatible or suitable static binaries; changing `--from` does not rebuild the installed tools for a different libc. System libraries required at runtime must be present in the image.

## Environment variables in the image [​](#environment-variables-in-the-image)

The image config's `Env` is built in this order (later entries win):

1. Base image env (from the pulled `--from` image's config).
2. Your `[env]` section from `mise.toml` (fully resolved — templates expanded, `.env` files read).
3. Each tool's `exec_env()` — e.g. `JAVA_HOME`, `GOROOT`, `GEM_HOME`. Paths are rebased from the host install dir onto the in-image path.
4. `[oci].env` entries.
5. Synthesized PATH (each tool's bin paths in the image) plus the inherited PATH.
6. `MISE_DATA_DIR=/mise` and `MISE_CONFIG_DIR=/etc/mise` — always applied last so they can't be shadowed.

Secrets in `[env]` are baked into the image

Anything in your mise `[env]` section — including values loaded from `.env` files — is written into the image config JSON and visible to anyone who runs `docker inspect` / `skopeo inspect`. **Do not put secrets there.** Use `docker run -e`, secret mounts, or orchestrator secrets at runtime. Use `[oci].env` only for values that are safe to live in the image.

mise emits a warning with the number of `[env]` vars it baked in.

## Supported backends [​](#supported-backends)

The builder accepts built-in backends and packages each selected tool's install directory. It also relocates supported executable paths and shebangs. Acceptance by the builder does not guarantee that a tool is self-contained: system libraries, external runtimes, or paths outside its installation may still be needed. Declare required runtimes alongside their tools and verify the resulting image with the commands your project actually runs.

asdf and vfox plugins, including custom vfox backend plugins, are rejected. Their installation hooks can write outside the per-version directory, which the per-tool layer model cannot capture reliably.

## Registry base-image support [​](#registry-base-image-support)

Base images can be pulled from any OCI Distribution v2 registry — Docker Hub, ghcr.io, quay.io, self-hosted, etc. Anonymous token auth is handled automatically for public images; when you're logged in (`docker login` / `podman login`), those credentials are used, so private base images work too.

Digest references are supported:

sh

```
mise oci build --from "REGISTRY/IMAGE@sha256:FULL_DIGEST"
```

Replace the placeholders with an actual image reference and its complete SHA256 digest. A digest pins the base image; a mutable tag can resolve to a new base on a later build.

## Reproducibility [​](#reproducibility)

On the same host, re-running `mise oci build` with unchanged inputs produces byte-identical tool layer digests. Across machines, layer digests may drift because compiled artifacts (pyc bytecode, generated node-gyp output, etc.) can embed absolute paths.

For fully-reproducible image config timestamps, set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`:

sh

```
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(git log -1 --format=%ct) mise oci build
```

## Cross-platform builds [​](#cross-platform-builds)

OCI images are Linux-targeted. Building on macOS or Windows produces an image whose `os` field is `linux`, but any embedded binaries (mise and every tool layer) are still host-native — they will fail with `Exec format error` when executed inside the container.

Build on a Linux host or in a Linux development container that already has mise and the required tool-installation dependencies. A stock `debian` image does not contain mise. Do not mount macOS or Windows tool installations into that container as substitutes for Linux installations. mise warns when host and image platforms do not match.

### Multi-arch images [​](#multi-arch-images)

A single host builds a single platform, but `mise oci push --update-index` lets one runner per architecture assemble a multi-arch tag: each push uploads its platform manifest by digest and points the tag at an OCI **image index** that preserves the entries other platforms pushed.

For example, the following GitHub Actions job builds one architecture at a time. It assumes the project has `mise.toml`, publishes to GHCR, and grants the workflow access to that package:

yaml

```
name: Publish development image
on: workflow_dispatch
permissions:
  contents: read
  packages: write
concurrency:
  group: mise-development-image
  cancel-in-progress: false
jobs:
  publish:
    strategy:
      max-parallel: 1
      matrix:
        runner: [ubuntu-24.04, ubuntu-24.04-arm]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.runner }}
    env:
      MISE_EXPERIMENTAL: "1"
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: jdx/mise-action@v4
      - name: Authenticate to GHCR
        env:
          GHCR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: printf '%s' "$GHCR_TOKEN" | docker login ghcr.io -u "$GITHUB_ACTOR" --password-stdin
      - name: Publish this architecture
        run: mise oci push --update-index "ghcr.io/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY,,}/dev:latest"
```

Choose runner labels available to your repository. Matrix serialization prevents the two platform pushes from racing, and workflow concurrency prevents overlapping runs of this workflow from updating the same tag simultaneously.

Re-pushing the same platform replaces its entry (no duplicates), and a previously single-arch tag is upgraded to an index without losing the existing platform. Layer reuse works through indexes — the cache resolves to the entry matching the build platform.

The index update is read-modify-write (the Distribution API has no conditional writes), so concurrent pushes to the same tag from different runners can race — sequence them as above.

## Known limitations (v1) [​](#known-limitations-v1)

- `asdf` / `vfox` backends are rejected (see above).
- Cross-platform builds produce broken images (binaries are host-native); run the build on a Linux host.
- The base image must supply a compatible libc and other runtime libraries.
- `mise oci run` needs a container engine (podman or docker) — mise has no built-in container runtime. Pushing needs no external tools.
