S3 Backend

S3 Backend [​](#s3-backend)

The `s3` backend installs binaries and archives from Amazon S3 or S3-compatible storage such as MinIO. Use it when access should follow your AWS credentials or when version discovery needs to list objects in a bucket. No AWS CLI is required.

The code for this is inside of the mise repository at [`./src/backend/s3.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/backend/s3.rs).

## Usage [​](#usage)

Replace the bucket and object key below with an artifact you can read for your platform. Use a concrete version for a fixed object URL:

sh

```
mise use "s3:my-tool[url=s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz]@1.0.0"
```

This writes the following to the project's `mise.toml`. Add `-g` for global configuration, and run `mise exec -- my-tool --version` to verify the install:

toml

```
[tools]
"s3:my-tool" = { version = "1.0.0", url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz" }
```

## Authentication [​](#authentication)

mise uses the AWS SDK's [default credential provider chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-rust/latest/dg/credproviders.html). It supports environment credentials, shared AWS profiles, web identity, and container or instance roles. Prefer an existing profile or workload role over copying long-lived access keys into project configuration.

For a configured local profile:

sh

```
AWS_PROFILE=development AWS_REGION=us-east-1 mise install
```

Temporary environment credentials require `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` as well as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. The `region` tool option can select the bucket's region explicitly.

Downloading a known object requires `s3:GetObject`. Discovery through an object prefix also requires `s3:ListBucket`; discovery through a manifest needs read access to that manifest. A successful object download does not prove that version listing is permitted.

## Tool Options [​](#tool-options)

The following [tool-options](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/#tool-options) are available for the `s3` backend—these go in `[tools]` in `mise.toml`.

### `url` (Required) [​](#url-required)

Specifies the S3 URL to download the tool from. The URL supports templating with `{{ version }}`:

toml

```
[tools]
"s3:my-tool" = { version = "1.0.0", url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v{{ version }}.tar.gz" }
```

### `endpoint` [​](#endpoint)

Specify a custom S3-compatible endpoint for services like MinIO, DigitalOcean Spaces, or self-hosted S3:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v{{ version }}.tar.gz"
endpoint = "https://minio.example.com"
```

### `region` [​](#region)

Specify the AWS region for the S3 bucket:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v{{ version }}.tar.gz"
region = "us-west-2"
```

### Platform-specific URLs [​](#platform-specific-urls)

For tools that need different downloads per platform, use the table format:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"

[tools."s3:my-tool".platforms]
macos-x64 = { url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v1.0.0-macos-x64.tar.gz" }
macos-arm64 = { url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v1.0.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz" }
linux-x64 = { url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v1.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz" }
```

### `checksum` [​](#checksum)

Set the expected digest for this version and object. Replace this placeholder with a complete digest obtained from a trusted source:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz"
checksum = "sha256:REPLACE_WITH_THE_64_HEX_DIGIT_DIGEST"
```

*Instead of specifying the checksum here, you can use [mise.lock](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/mise-lock.html) to manage checksums.*

### `size` [​](#size)

Check the expected object size in bytes. The numbers below illustrate the syntax; replace them with the actual sizes. This does not replace a checksum:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz"
size = "12345678"
```

You can specify different sizes for different platforms:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"

[tools."s3:my-tool".platforms]
macos-arm64 = { url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v1.0.0-macos-arm64.tar.gz", size = "9876543" }
linux-x64 = { url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v1.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz", size = "12345678" }
```

### `strip_components` [​](#strip-components)

Number of directory components to strip when extracting archives:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz"
strip_components = 1
```

INFO

When both `strip_components` and `bin_path` are unset, mise automatically detects when to apply `strip_components = 1`. This happens when the extracted archive contains exactly one directory at the root level and no files.

### `bin` [​](#bin)

Rename the downloaded binary to a specific name. This is useful when downloading a single binary object that has a platform-specific name:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-linux-x86_64"
bin = "my-tool"
```

INFO

When downloading single binaries (not archives), mise automatically removes OS/arch suffixes from the filename. For example, `my-tool-linux-x86_64` becomes `my-tool`. Use the `bin` option only when you need a specific custom name.

### `rename_exe` [​](#rename-exe)

Rename the executable after extraction from an archive. This is useful when the archive contains a binary with a platform-specific name that you want to rename:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v1.0.0-linux.zip"
rename_exe = "my-tool"
```

TIP

Use `rename_exe` for archives where the binary inside has a different name than desired. Use `bin` for single binary downloads (not archives).

### `bin_path` [​](#bin-path)

Specify the directory containing binaries within the extracted archive. This disables automatic root stripping. For an archive shaped like `my-tool-VERSION/bin/my-tool`, set both options explicitly:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v1.0.0.tar.gz"
strip_components = 1
bin_path = "bin" # after stripping an outer my-tool-VERSION directory
```

### `format` [​](#format)

Explicitly specify the archive format when the URL lacks a file extension:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v1.0.0"
format = "tar.gz"
```

## Version Discovery [​](#version-discovery)

The S3 backend supports a manifest or object listing. Configure one before using `latest`, then check it with `mise ls-remote s3:my-tool`. The examples use placeholder buckets that you must replace with your own.

### Manifest File [​](#manifest-file)

Fetch available versions from a JSON manifest file stored in S3:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "latest"
url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v{{ version }}.tar.gz"
version_list_url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/versions.json"
```

The manifest file can be a JSON array of version strings:

json

```
["1.0.0", "1.1.0", "2.0.0"]
```

Or a JSON array of objects (use `version_json_path` to extract versions):

json

```
[{ "version": "1.0.0" }, { "version": "1.1.0" }, { "version": "2.0.0" }]
```

### `version_json_path` [​](#version-json-path)

Extract versions from JSON responses using a jq-like path expression:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "latest"
url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v{{ version }}.tar.gz"
version_list_url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/releases.json"
version_json_path = ".[].version"
```

### `version_expr` [​](#version-expr)

Extract versions using an [expr-lang](https://expr-lang.org/) expression for complex version extraction logic:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "latest"
url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v{{ version }}.tar.gz"
version_list_url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/versions.txt"
version_expr = 'split(body, "\n")'
```

The expression receives the response body as the `body` variable and should return an array of version strings.

### S3 Object Listing [​](#s3-object-listing)

Discover versions by listing objects in the S3 bucket:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-tool"]
version = "latest"
url = "s3://my-bucket/tools/my-tool-v{{ version }}.tar.gz"
version_prefix = "tools/my-tool-v"
version_regex = 'my-tool-v(.+)\.tar\.gz$'
```

- `version_prefix`: The S3 key prefix to list objects from
- `version_regex`: A regular expression to extract version numbers from object keys (first capturing group is used)

## Custom Endpoint Example (MinIO) [​](#custom-endpoint-example-minio)

Here's a complete example using MinIO as an S3-compatible backend:

toml

```
[tools."s3:my-internal-tool"]
version = "latest"
url = "s3://tools-bucket/releases/my-tool-{{ version }}.tar.gz"
endpoint = "https://minio.example.com"
region = "us-east-1"
version_list_url = "s3://tools-bucket/releases/versions.json"
strip_components = 1 # assumes one outer directory containing bin/
bin_path = "bin"
```

Provide the MinIO access key and secret through an AWS-compatible profile or the standard environment variables, then run `mise install`. A custom endpoint uses path-style bucket addressing; it must be reachable with a trusted TLS certificate.

## Comparison with HTTP Backend [​](#comparison-with-http-backend)

| Feature | S3 Backend | HTTP Backend |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication | AWS credentials (env vars, \~/.aws/credentials, IAM) | HTTP auth headers |
| Version discovery | S3 listing or manifest file | HTTP endpoint |
| Custom endpoints | Yes (MinIO, etc.) | N/A |
| Use case | AWS-authenticated object storage | Public or authenticated HTTP downloads |

## Troubleshooting [​](#troubleshooting)

| Error | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Access denied | The selected profile or role, object read permissions, and listing permissions when using `version_prefix`. |
| Object not found | The bucket, full key, concrete version, and rendered platform URL. |
| Signature mismatch | Credentials, session token, region, endpoint, and local clock. |
| No versions | The manifest format or listing prefix and capture group. A download URL alone does not define a version list. |
| Installed command missing | The archive structure after root stripping and the `bin` or `bin_path` option. |
