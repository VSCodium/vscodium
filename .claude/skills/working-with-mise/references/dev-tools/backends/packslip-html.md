Packslip Backend

Packslip Backend [​](#packslip-backend)

The [Packslip](https://packslip.dev) backend installs tools using signed release manifests published by their maintainers. mise verifies the release, selects the build for your platform, and installs its executables. Releases can also include shell completions and agent skills.

Packslip is the preferred [Tier 1 backend](https://mise.jdx.dev/registry.html#backends) for tools whose publishers provide these manifests. For other tools, use [aqua](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/aqua.html), [GitHub](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/github.html), or another supported backend. You do not need to install the Packslip CLI.

For the background and examples of version-matched completions and agent skills, read [Introducing packslip](https://jdx.dev/posts/2026-09-05-introducing-packslip/).

## Quick start [​](#usage)

Install [hk](https://hk.jdx.dev), a git hook and lint manager, in your project:

sh

```
mise use packslip:github.com/jdx/hk
mise exec -- hk --version
```

This records hk in the project's `mise.toml`. The equivalent configuration is:

toml

```
[tools]
"packslip:github.com/jdx/hk" = "latest"
```

Run `mise install` after adding that configuration manually. To make hk available outside a project, use `mise use -g packslip:github.com/jdx/hk`. The registry shorthand `mise use hk` also selects Packslip by default.

## Supported project identifiers [​](#project-names-and-discovery)

Use `packslip:` followed by the project's host and path, without `https://`. For GitHub, you can omit the host: `packslip:jdx/hk` is equivalent to `packslip:github.com/jdx/hk`.

| Identifier | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `packslip:github.com/owner/repo` | A GitHub repository's releases. |
| `packslip:github.com/owner/repo/tools/mytool` | One tool in a GitHub monorepo. |
| `packslip:tool.example.com` | A signed release list hosted by the publisher. |
| `packslip:example.com/tools/mytool` | One tool on a publisher's domain. |

The project must publish Packslip manifests; this backend does not infer installation instructions from arbitrary release filenames. GitHub projects have built-in release discovery and signer identity rules. Other hosts need a signed release list and an explicit [signer configuration](#pubkey).

For bundle filenames, discovery URLs, and monorepo identity rules, see [project discovery](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-verification.html#project-discovery).

### Private GitHub repositories [​](#private-repositories)

A private repository works with the same credentials the [`github:` backend](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/github-tokens.html) uses — `MISE_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`, or `GITHUB_TOKEN` — and needs nothing in your configuration:

mise.toml

toml

```
[tools]
"packslip:github.com/my-org/internal-cli" = "latest"
```

GitHub serves release assets of a private repository only from its API, not from the `github.com/.../releases/download/...` URLs a manifest records, so mise retries there with your token when a download fails. The token is used for transport only: the signature, project identity, signer continuity, and artifact digest checks are unchanged, and no credential is read from the signed manifest.

## Versions [​](#versions)

List available versions or select a specific release:

sh

```
mise ls-remote packslip:github.com/jdx/hk
mise use packslip:github.com/jdx/hk@1.58.1
```

Only releases with Packslip manifests are available through this backend. The registry shorthand selects Aqua for hk versions before 1.58.1, so `mise use hk@1.57.0` continues to work. You can also select Aqua explicitly with `mise use aqua:jdx/hk@VERSION`.

Packslip uses semantic versions, including compatible date versions such as `2026.9.1`. Prereleases are excluded unless you enable the [`prerelease`](#prerelease) tool option. mise also applies [`minimum_release_age`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#minimum_release_age), which defaults to 24 hours. A recently published release may therefore be absent from the list until it reaches that age.

### How `latest` is selected [​](#latest)

`latest` follows the publisher's recommendation when it is eligible:

1. The publisher's `latest` pointer in a signed release list.
2. GitHub's latest release, if there is no signed pointer.
3. The highest eligible semantic version, if there is no eligible recommendation.

A publisher can recommend an older supported release even when a newer major version exists. Prefix and channel requests keep their normal matching rules. Every candidate must satisfy the configured verification and installation policies.

Offline, version listing and `latest` use cached results, or return no versions if the cache is empty. Installation still performs verification. See [version resolution](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-verification.html#version-resolution) for signed lists, withdrawals, and fallback behavior.

### Reproduce an installation [​](#reproduce-an-installation)

A `latest` request can resolve differently after the publisher recommends a new release. Keep the request in `mise.toml` and commit a generated lockfile when your team needs to install the same version:

sh

```
mise install
git add mise.toml mise.lock
```

The first installation records the version, signer, and artifact commitments in `mise.lock`; commit that file with `mise.toml`. Teammates and CI can then enforce those commitments after checking out the project:

sh

```
mise install --locked
```

`mise lock` can resolve the Packslip version without installing it, but it cannot record the selected artifact's commitments before the first installation. Installation still needs the artifacts or usable cached copies and must satisfy current verification policy. See [mise.lock](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/mise-lock.html) for target platforms and updates.

## Completions and skills [​](#completions)

With [mise activated](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#activate-mise), installing hk also makes its completions available:

sh

```
mise use packslip:github.com/jdx/hk
```

Type `hk` and press Tab. mise loads the completion script declared by hk's release and follows the hk version active in each project. No separate completion installation or `usage` dependency is needed. Bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell are supported. See [Packslip completions](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-resources.html#completions) for details and manual setup without shell activation.

Tools can also publish agent skills. Use `mise skills ls` to see the skills provided by active tools and `mise skills sync --dir .agents/skills` to link them into your agent's directory. A tool must declare a skill for it to appear.

See [Packslip completions and skills](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-resources.html) for setup, automatic skill synchronization, and when resource generation runs a publisher's executable.

## Verification [​](#what-is-verified)

mise verifies the publisher's signature, the requested project and version, and the selected download's digest and size before unpacking it. The signer must match the expected repository identity or your configured public key. mise also checks any existing signer pin, lockfile commitments, and applicable release-age or stamper policy.

A **manifest** describes the release. A **bundle** contains the manifest and its signature evidence. An **artifact** is a downloadable build named by the manifest. mise retains the verified manifest as `.mise-packslip.json` in the install directory.

Verification authenticates the publisher and downloaded bytes. It does not establish that the software is safe. mise records whether build provenance links are present, but does not fetch and verify that linked provenance. See [verification details](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-verification.html#verification-checks).

### Signer changes [​](#pinned-signers)

mise remembers previously accepted signers in its local state. [`mise.lock`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/mise-lock.html) can also record the project's signer and artifact checksums, carrying those commitments to another machine.

If a release changes signer, inspect the remembered identity:

sh

```
mise packslip pins
mise packslip pins --json
```

After confirming the publisher's announced signing-key or workflow change, reset the local pin for that project:

sh

```
mise packslip forget github.com/jdx/hk
```

This also resets the remembered vendor release-list continuity. It does **not** change explicit signer options, erase stamper-list state, or remove a signer commitment from `mise.lock`. Configure the new signer policy first; if a lockfile entry conflicts, remove that entry and regenerate it with `mise install`. Review and commit the resulting lockfile change. See [signer continuity](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-verification.html#signer-continuity) for the changes that require this review.

## Tool options [​](#tool-options)

These [tool options](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/#tool-options) apply to one entry in `[tools]`. The settings `packslip.exec`, `packslip.stampers`, and `skills.*` belong under `[settings]` instead.

| Option | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`variant`](#variant) | No variant | Select a publisher-declared alternative build. |
| [`pubkey`](#pubkey) | Unset | Pin a minisign-format public key or public-key file. |
| [`identity`, `identity_prefix`, `issuer`](#identity-identity-prefix-issuer) | Derived from a recognized forge | Set the expected keyless signer and OIDC issuer. |
| [`list_identity_prefix`](#list-identity-prefix) | Release signer policy | Pin a different workflow for the vendor release list. |
| [`prerelease`](#prerelease) | `false` | Include prerelease versions. |
| [`trust`](#trust) | Apply configured stampers | Use `"vendor"` to exempt this tool from stamp requirements. |
| [`allow_unlogged`](#allow-unlogged) | `false` | Accept key-signed bundles without transparency-log evidence. |
| [`ignore_requirements`](#ignore-requirements) | `false` | Install despite confirmed host requirement failures. |

### `variant` [​](#variant)

Select a named alternative build, such as `fips` or `baseline`. Without this option, mise considers only artifacts with no variant. The publisher must provide the requested variant.

toml

```
[tools]
"packslip:github.com/example/tool" = { version = "latest", variant = "fips" }
```

### `pubkey` [​](#pubkey)

For a key-signed project, obtain the publisher's public key through a trusted channel. Set `pubkey` to the minisign-format public-key line or the path to its `.pub` file. The release list and bundles must verify against that key.

toml

```
[tools]
"packslip:tool.example.com" = { version = "latest", pubkey = "/path/to/vendor.pub" }
```

### `identity`, `identity_prefix`, `issuer` [​](#identity-identity-prefix-issuer)

For keyless signing, specify an exact certificate `identity` or an `identity_prefix`, plus its OIDC `issuer`. These options override the policy derived from the forge name. Keep the trailing slash in a repository prefix. For example, a domain project signed by a GitHub workflow could use:

toml

```
[tools]
"packslip:tool.example.com" = { version = "latest", identity_prefix = "https://github.com/example/tool/", issuer = "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" }
```

Replace the example identity with the publisher's verified identity. Recognizing the signing issuer does not add release discovery: the domain still needs a [signed release list](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-verification.html#project-discovery).

### `list_identity_prefix` [​](#list-identity-prefix)

When a different workflow signs the vendor's release list, pin its certificate identity prefix separately. It replaces `identity` and `identity_prefix` only for the vendor's list; release bundles still require their original signer. The OIDC `issuer` is shared (including an issuer derived from a forge project). Without this option, the list uses the same policy as release bundles.

The value must be a non-empty string and requires an issuer. It cannot be combined with `pubkey`. It does not affect configured stampers, whose lists use their own pins.

### `prerelease` [​](#prerelease)

Include prereleases when listing or selecting versions:

toml

```
[tools]
"packslip:github.com/jdx/hk" = { version = "latest", prerelease = true }
```

### `trust` [​](#trust)

Use `trust = "vendor"` to exempt one tool from configured [stampers](#stamps). Vendor signature verification still applies, and mise records this choice in the lockfile options.

toml

```
[tools]
"packslip:github.com/jdx/hk" = { version = "latest", trust = "vendor" }
```

### `allow_unlogged` [​](#allow-unlogged)

Set to `true` only when your policy accepts key-signed bundles without transparency-log evidence. Signature and artifact verification still apply.

### `ignore_requirements` [​](#ignore-requirements)

Set to `true` to install despite confirmed [host requirement](#host-requirements) failures. This does not supply missing libraries or make an incompatible executable run. It also bypasses the glibc-to-musl fallback, retaining the GNU artifact selected for the host. Other verification checks still apply.

## Advanced policies [​](#advanced-policies)

### Signed release lists [​](#signed-release-lists)

Publishers can use signed lists to recommend or withdraw versions and provide bundle locations. For domain projects, a list is required; for GitHub, it supplements release discovery. See [signed release lists](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-verification.html#signed-release-lists).

Accepted lists must remain available and current. See [list continuity and release age](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-verification.html#release-list-continuity-and-minimum-age) for expiry, rollback protection, and timestamp checks.

### Stamps [​](#stamps)

Stampers are services you configure to approve releases in addition to the publisher's signature. No stamps are required by default. See [stamper configuration and mirrors](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-verification.html#stamps).

### Artifact selection and host requirements [​](#artifact-selection)

mise selects a build using the signed OS, architecture, libc, and variant metadata, then checks its declared host requirements. When a GNU build's declared `glibc_min` is newer than the host, mise selects a matching static musl build when one is available. Setting `ignore_requirements = true` bypasses this fallback and keeps the GNU artifact selected. An ambiguous build or another confirmed incompatibility can prevent installation. See [artifact selection](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-verification.html#artifact-selection) and [host requirements](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-verification.html#host-requirements).

## Troubleshooting [​](#troubleshooting)

Start with debug output for the failing command, for example:

sh

```
MISE_DEBUG=1 mise install packslip:github.com/jdx/hk
```

| Symptom | Next step |
| --- | --- |
| No versions or bundle found | Check the project identifier and `mise ls-remote`. Confirm that the release has a Packslip manifest and is old enough for `minimum_release_age`. The publisher must supply missing manifests. |
| Nothing pins the signer | Configure `pubkey`, or a certificate identity/prefix and issuer, using details confirmed with the publisher. |
| Signer change or trust downgrade refused | Inspect `mise packslip pins`, explicit tool options, and `mise.lock`. Follow [signer changes](#pinned-signers) after confirming the publisher's change. |
| No eligible artifact | Check your platform and requested variant. The publisher must provide a matching build. |
| Ambiguous artifacts | The publisher must distinguish the builds in the manifest; changing local options cannot fix identical metadata. |
| Host requirements failed | Install the reported dependency or use a compatible host. See [host requirements](#host-requirements) before overriding a failure. |
| Signed list expired, rolled back, or missing | Ask the list's publisher for a current valid list. Removing an accepted list does not reset its policy. |
| Version excluded by stamp policy | Check your configured stampers. A trusted stamper must approve the version, and the vendor must not have withdrawn it. |
| Digest or size mismatch | Report the affected release and artifact to the publisher; the download must match the signed manifest. |
| 404 on a private repository's release | Confirm the token in `MISE_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_API_TOKEN`, or `GITHUB_TOKEN` can read the repository. See [private repositories](#private-repositories). |

## Publishing tools for mise [​](#why-publish-one)

A Packslip manifest lets mise install your releases without a new registry shorthand or a separate filename-matching recipe. You can keep your existing release layout and add versioned completions, CLI specifications, or agent skills.

To support mise:

1. Publish installable artifacts with accurate platform metadata and executable paths.
2. Sign a manifest containing their digests and publish its bundle with the release.
3. For domain hosting, publish a signed release list and tell users how to pin your signer.
4. Optionally declare [completions and skills](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/packslip-resources.html).

For GitHub Actions, follow the [Packslip publishing guide](https://packslip.dev/docs/publishing/) for the action version, permissions, inputs, and monorepo setup. Run the action after building and uploading the final artifacts. For domain hosting, see [signed release lists](https://packslip.dev/docs/release-lists/).

The [Packslip specification](https://packslip.dev/release/v1/) defines the format. For mise's implementation details, see [`src/backend/packslip.rs`](https://github.com/jdx/mise/blob/main/src/backend/packslip.rs).
