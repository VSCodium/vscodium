Packslip Verification and Policy

Packslip Verification and Policy [​](#packslip-verification-and-policy)

mise uses Packslip's signed metadata to discover releases, verify publishers, and select compatible builds. This guide describes the discovery and policy rules behind the [Packslip backend](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/packslip.html). For installation examples and tool options, start with that page.

A **manifest** describes a release, a **bundle** contains that manifest and its signature evidence, and an **artifact** is a downloadable build named by the manifest. A **signed release list** indexes versions and can recommend or withdraw them.

## Inspect the tool and accepted signers [​](#inspect-the-tool-and-accepted-signers)

Before investigating a verification error, identify the backend and version in use, then inspect the signer state without changing it:

sh

```
mise tool hk
mise ls --current
mise packslip pins
mise packslip pins --json
```

Replace `hk` with the affected tool. The pins commands list previously accepted identities; they do not re-verify an installed executable or grant trust to a new signer. Compare the relevant project with its lockfile entry and the error before following a signer-rotation procedure.

## Project discovery [​](#project-discovery)

| Project form | Where mise looks |
| --- | --- |
| `github.com/owner/repo` | GitHub releases carrying `packslip.sigstore.json`. |
| `github.com/owner/repo/tools/mytool` | The repository's releases, using `packslip.tools-mytool.sigstore.json`. |
| `tool.example.com` | `https://tool.example.com/.well-known/packslip.json`. |
| `example.com/tools/mytool` | `https://example.com/.well-known/packslip/tools/mytool.json`. |

A GitHub monorepo subpath identifies one tool, but the signing identity is still pinned to the repository. The signed project and version must match the requested tool and release, regardless of the bundle's filename.

For domain projects, the signed list supplies bundle URLs; artifacts may live on another download host. A domain without a signed list cannot be installed. Recognizing a forge's signing issuer does not provide release discovery: GitHub has a release-API integration; other hosts need the signed-list location.

## Version resolution [​](#version-resolution)

Packslip versions use semantic versioning, including compatible date versions such as `2026.9.1`. The version determines ordering and prerelease status; GitHub's release order and editable prerelease flag do not determine either.

For GitHub discovery, mise reads versions from tags such as `v1.2.3`, `mytool-v1.2.3`, or `v4.1` (normalized to `4.1.0`). Tags that do not map to a version need an explicit mapping in a signed list. At installation, the manifest's version must agree with the tag or list entry.

### Signed release lists [​](#signed-release-lists)

A GitHub repository can publish a supplementary signed list on its default branch at `.well-known/packslip.json`, or `.well-known/packslip/<tool>.json` for a monorepo tool. The list can withdraw a version, supply a bundle URL and digest, or add a version that the release API does not expose.

Omitted versions can still come from GitHub releases: omission does not withdraw them. For a domain project, the signed list supplies the entire release index. A vendor withdrawal excludes a version even if a trusted stamper approved it.

### Release-list continuity and minimum age [​](#release-list-continuity-and-minimum-age)

mise rejects expired signed lists and sequences below the highest it has accepted for the project. Once it has accepted a supplementary GitHub list, that list disappearing is an error. This prevents a missing list from silently undoing a withdrawal. The remembered list state is stored alongside the [signer pin](#signer-continuity).

With [minimum release age](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#minimum_release_age) enabled, discovery timestamps help filter candidates. Before downloading an artifact, mise checks the verified transparency-log timestamp against the effective cutoff. Only an explicitly allowed unlogged bundle uses the signed publication timestamp instead.

The cutoff decides which release a fuzzy request may pick, so it does not apply to a release that was already chosen: an exact pin such as `"packslip:github.com/jdx/hk" = "2.0.1"` and a version recorded in `mise.lock` both install and lock while the release is still cooling. Fuzzy requests like `latest` or `2` stay behind the cutoff, and the `npm:` and `pipx:` backends still apply it to unpinned transitive dependencies.

### Recommendations and fallback [​](#recommendations-and-fallback)

For an unconstrained `latest` request, mise considers the vendor's signed recommendation first, then GitHub's latest release if there is no signed pointer. Without an eligible recommendation, mise selects the highest eligible semantic version. Prefix and channel requests keep their normal matching rules; the recommendation does not reorder them.

A recommendation must pass signature, identity, digest, release-age, stamping, and host checks. A policy exclusion warns and tries another candidate. An ineligible signed recommendation falls directly back to semantic-version selection, without consulting GitHub's pointer. Signature or digest failures and invalid, expired, rolled-back, or unexpectedly missing lists stop resolution.

For a stamped release, mise fetches the bundle from the stamp's URL and checks the vendor's list for withdrawals and any recorded digest. Resolution and installation use the same source and verification policy.

### Caching and offline use [​](#caching-and-offline-use)

Online version listing and `latest` resolution read policy afresh so withdrawals and trust changes take effect. They write the results to mise's remote-version cache. Offline, both use that cache, or return no versions if it is empty. Installation still rechecks verification policy. A cached version list alone is not sufficient for an offline install: required bundles, artifacts, and trust evidence must also be available.

## Verification checks [​](#verification-checks)

Before unpacking a release, mise checks:

1. The bundle's signature and applicable certificate and transparency-log evidence against the expected repository identity or configured key.
2. The manifest's structure, requested project and version, and any bundle digest recorded by a vendor list or trusted stamper.
3. Signer continuity, lockfile commitments, and applicable release-age policy.
4. The selected artifact's digest and size, plus any existing lockfile checksum.

The verified manifest is retained as `.mise-packslip.json` in the install directory. It supplies executable paths and metadata for resources.

Verification authenticates the signer and downloaded bytes. A provenance link in the manifest is separate evidence: mise records its presence for continuity checks but does not fetch and verify the linked build provenance.

## Signer continuity [​](#signer-continuity)

mise preserves trust in two places:

| State | What it records |
| --- | --- |
| `packslip/pins.toml` under the [state directory](https://mise.jdx.dev/directories.html#local-state-mise) | Previously accepted signers, signing scheme, vendor versus repackager status, provenance-link presence, and release-list continuity. |
| `mise.lock` | The project's signer and attestor commitment alongside each platform's artifact URL and checksum, including on another machine's first install. |

For a keyless signer, continuity compares the workflow path without its tag or branch ref. A new release tag of the same workflow is the same signer. A new workflow path or key requires an explicit trust decision. A signing-scheme change, a vendor-to-repackager change, or lost provenance links can also be refused.

Deleting `pins.toml` resets local continuity for every recorded project. It is not a routine remedy for an installation failure, and it does not remove signer commitments from a project lockfile.

See [signer changes](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/packslip.html#pinned-signers) for inspection and reset commands, including how explicit options and lockfile commitments affect a rotation.

## Stamps [​](#stamps)

A stamper is a registry, mirror, or review service that publishes a signed list of releases it approves. No stamps are required by default. To require them, configure the hosts you trust and the key or identity allowed to sign each host's lists:

toml

```
[settings.packslip]
stampers = [
  "stamps.example.com=/path/to/stamper.pub",
  "reviews.example.com=https://github.com/example/reviews/",
]
```

Each entry is `host=PIN`. The pin may be a minisign-format public-key line, a public-key file path, or a GitHub identity prefix. Replace the example hosts and key path with a service and pin you trust.

A host publishes one list per project at `https://<host>/.well-known/packslip/<project>.json`. With stampers configured:

- A version needs a non-yanked approval from at least one trusted host to be listed or installed. One host's withdrawal does not veto another's approval.
- A vendor withdrawal still excludes the release, regardless of stamps.
- mise checks the stamped bundle digest and the vendor-list digest, when present, then verifies the vendor signature. A stamp never replaces that signature.
- A stamp without a digest is refused: the approval must identify the bundle's contents, not just its URL.
- Expired, rolled-back, invalid, or previously accepted but now missing stamper lists cause errors.

To exempt one tool while retaining vendor verification, set its [`trust = "vendor"`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/packslip.html#trust) tool option.

### Mirrors [​](#mirrors)

A stamper can mirror the exact vendor-signed bundle. mise fetches it from the stamp's URL and checks the vendor's list for withdrawals and any recorded digest. Deleting a GitHub release asset does not block an approved mirror of a release that the vendor has not withdrawn. Re-signed repackager bundles requiring a separate identity policy are not supported here.

## Interpreting policy failures [​](#interpreting-policy-failures)

| Failure | Next step |
| --- | --- |
| Signer or signing scheme changed | Compare the old pin and lockfile commitment with the publisher's announced rotation |
| Signed list expired, rolled back, or disappeared | Check the publisher or stamper's current list; removing local state would discard the continuity check |
| Release withdrawn or lacks a required stamp | Select a release allowed by the configured policy |
| Bundle or artifact digest mismatch | Check the release source or mirror; do not accept new bytes merely to clear the error |
| No matching artifact or unresolved tie | Check the platform and variant, or ask the publisher to distinguish its builds |
| Host requirement failed | Install the requirement or use a supported host; bypassing the check does not supply it |

The errors identify different stages. Changing an artifact option cannot repair an invalid signature, and forgetting a signer pin cannot repair a digest mismatch.

## Artifact selection [​](#artifact-selection)

mise uses signed metadata to select one artifact:

1. Match OS, architecture, and libc. An absent field leaves only that dimension unrestricted: a universal macOS build still requires macOS.
2. With a `variant`, consider only that variant. Without one, consider only artifacts that have no variant.
3. Keep formats mise can install, preferring the most specific platform match, then its archive/compression format preference over a bare executable.
4. Refuse an unresolved tie rather than guessing between builds.

Installer formats such as `deb`, `dmg`, and `msi` are not selected. A glibc host may use a matching static musl artifact when there is no GNU artifact, or when the selected GNU artifact declares a `glibc_min` above the host's detected version. mise reports that fallback in the debug log. The publisher must distinguish alternative builds with variants. A client option cannot resolve two identically described artifacts.

## Host requirements [​](#host-requirements)

After selecting an artifact, mise checks its declared requirements before downloading it. Requirements do not break a selection tie. A confirmed `glibc_min` incompatibility may select the matching static musl build as described above; other requirements do not select another build.

| Requirement result | mise behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Insufficient glibc with a matching static musl artifact | Select the musl artifact. |
| Confirmed missing library, insufficient glibc without a fallback, or insufficient OS version | Refuse installation. |
| Missing or outdated required command | Warn and continue. |
| A check cannot be completed | Warn instead of assuming the host is incompatible. |

Command checks prefer active mise tools over ambient PATH. mise checks for a path the OS can execute: on Windows, `git.exe` or `node.cmd` counts, but a shebang-only script does not.

Library detection is platform-dependent. For example, an absent macOS library file may still exist in the dyld shared cache, so mise reports that absence as unknown. On Linux, the OS version is the kernel release from `uname -r`, read up to the distribution's suffix: `6.8.0-31-generic` is compared as `6.8.0`.

The [`ignore_requirements`](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/packslip.html#ignore-requirements) tool option permits installation despite confirmed failures. It also bypasses the glibc-to-musl fallback and retains the selected GNU artifact. It does not supply missing libraries or make an incompatible executable run.
