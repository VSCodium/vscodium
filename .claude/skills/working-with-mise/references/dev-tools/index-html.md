Dev Tools

Dev Tools [​](#dev-tools)

mise installs development tools and selects their versions for each project. Keep multiple versions of Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and other tools on the same machine, then declare which ones a project uses in `mise.toml`.

## Add a tool to a project [​](#add-a-tool-to-a-project)

From the project directory:

sh

```
mise use node@24 python@3.13
```

This installs the tools and records the version requests in your configuration:

mise.toml

toml

```
[tools]
node = "24"
python = "3.13"
```

Run a command with those tools:

sh

```
mise exec -- node --version
```

With [shell activation](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#activate-mise), you can run `node --version` directly. mise updates your shell environment as you move between projects. Activation selects installed tools; use `mise install` to install tools after cloning a repository or editing its configuration.

## Choose the right command [​](#choose-the-right-command)

| Goal | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Add or change a project's tool version | `mise use node@24` |
| Set a personal default | `mise use --global node@24` |
| Install tools declared by a project | `mise install` |
| Try a version without saving it | `mise exec node@24 -- node --version` |
| Show tools selected by the current configuration | `mise ls --current` |
| Upgrade within the configured version request | `mise upgrade node` |

A version request such as `"24"` selects a release in that series. An exact pin selects a specific release. See [mise.lock](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/mise-lock.html) for recording resolved versions without replacing the version requests in `mise.toml`.

## How tools are selected [​](#how-tools-are-selected)

1. mise discovers configuration in the current directory and its parents, along with global configuration. More specific configuration can override defaults.
2. Each tool's [backend](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/) resolves its version request and handles installation. The [registry](https://mise.jdx.dev/registry.html) maps short tool names to backends, so you usually don't need to choose one yourself.
3. mise adds the selected tools to the command's `PATH`. By default, `mise exec` and `mise run` install missing tools before executing the command or task.

Use `mise config ls` to inspect active configuration files. See [configuration](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration.html) for the full precedence rules.

### Shells, editors, and scripts [​](#shells-editors-and-scripts)

- **Interactive shells:** [activate mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#activate-mise) to update `PATH` and project environment variables at each prompt.
- **Editors:** use [IDE integration](https://mise.jdx.dev/ide-integration.html), including [shims](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/shims.html) where a program needs a stable executable path.
- **Scripts and CI:** use `mise exec -- <command>` or `mise run <task>` to load the project environment without relying on shell startup files.

### Existing version files [​](#existing-version-files)

mise also reads asdf `.tool-versions` files. Tool-specific files such as `.nvmrc` and `.python-version` require enabling [idiomatic version files](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration.html#idiomatic-version-files). For migration guidance, see [comparison to asdf](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/comparison-to-asdf.html).

### Templates in tool configuration [​](#templates-in-tool-configuration)

Tool versions and options can reference environment variables and [`vars`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/vars.html), including values from `_.source`, `_.file`, and environment modules. Those values are resolved before tool templates render. This includes `install_env`, which is useful for pointing an install at a directory that only exists under the current user's home:

toml

```
[tools]
swift = { version = "6.3.3", install_env = { LD_LIBRARY_PATH = "{{env.HOME}}/.local/lib/compat" } }
```

## Tool Options [​](#tool-options)

Tool options customize installation for a particular backend. Start with the backend's reference: a valid option for one backend may not apply to another source for the same tool.

Examples use TOML 1.1, which allows multiline inline tables and trailing commas inside them. Use that form when splitting an option across lines improves readability.

### Table Format (Recommended) [​](#table-format-recommended)

Use TOML tables when an option has nested fields. This illustrates the HTTP backend's platform mapping; replace the example URLs with your own release assets:

mise.toml

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"

[tools."http:my-tool".platforms]
macos-x64 = {
  url = "https://example.com/my-tool-macos-x64.tar.gz",
}
linux-x64 = {
  url = "https://example.com/my-tool-linux-x64.tar.gz",
}
```

See the [HTTP backend](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/http.html) for checksums, executable selection, and additional platform mappings.

### Dotted Notation [​](#dotted-notation)

The same nested fields can be written with dotted keys:

toml

```
[tools."http:my-tool"]
version = "1.0.0"
platforms.macos-x64.url = "https://example.com/my-tool-macos-x64.tar.gz"
platforms.linux-x64.url = "https://example.com/my-tool-linux-x64.tar.gz"
```

### Generic Nested Support [​](#generic-nested-support)

mise accepts nested TOML options, but the selected backend must understand them. Nesting is a way to organize documented options; it does not define a new backend or add arbitrary capabilities to an existing one. For a short declaration, use a single-line inline table:

toml

```
[tools]
node = { version = "24", postinstall = "node --version" }
```

### Version ordering [​](#version-ordering)

Backends normally preserve the order returned by their version source. Aqua, GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo, and HTTP tools can opt into semantic version precedence when an upstream publishes backports after newer release lines:

toml

```
[tools]
"github:owner/tool" = { version = "latest", version_order = "semver" }
```

For `latest`, an authoritative result from the backend still wins—for example, the release marked **Latest** on GitHub or Forgejo. If that release does not match the requested package, or the backend has no authoritative latest result, mise falls back to the version list and applies `version_order` there. This is important for repositories containing multiple products: their repository-wide Latest release may not contain an asset for every package.

With `version_order = "semver"`, mise orders valid semantic versions by precedence in `mise ls-remote` output and when resolving that list or a version prefix. Opaque versions retain their source order before semantic versions, so exact requests such as `nightly` continue to work. Build metadata does not affect precedence. Registry entries may set this option for tools known to follow semantic versioning; users can set `version_order = "source"` to restore the backend's default ordering.

### Tool postinstall commands [​](#tool-postinstall-commands)

Run a command immediately after a tool finishes installing by adding a `postinstall` field to that tool's configuration. This is separate from `[hooks].postinstall` and applies only when that specific tool is installed.

toml

```
[tools]
node = { version = "22", postinstall = "corepack enable" }
```

Behavior:

- The command runs once the install completes successfully for that tool/version.
- The tool's bin path is on PATH during the command, so you can invoke the installed tool directly.
- Environment variables include `MISE_TOOL_INSTALL_PATH` pointing to the tool's install directory and any variables from that tool's `install_env` option.
- If the install fails, the `postinstall` command is not run.

## OS-Specific Tools [​](#os-specific-tools)

You can restrict tools to specific operating systems using the `os` field:

toml

```
[tools]
# Only install on Linux and macOS
ripgrep = { version = "latest", os = ["linux", "macos"] }

# Only install on Windows
"github:PowerShell/PowerShell" = { version = "latest", os = ["windows"] }

# Works with other options
"cargo:usage-cli" = {
  version = "latest",
  os = ["linux", "macos"],
  locked = false,
}
```

The `os` field accepts an array of operating system identifiers:

- `"linux"` - All Linux distributions
- `"macos"` - macOS (Darwin). `"darwin"` is also accepted as an alias.
- `"windows"` - Windows. `"win"` is also accepted as an alias.
- `"unix"` - Every platform except Windows, such as Linux and macOS

### OS/Architecture Combinations [​](#os-architecture-combinations)

You can also restrict tools to specific OS and architecture combinations using the `os/arch` syntax:

toml

```
[tools]
# Only install on macOS ARM64 and all Linux (skips macOS x86_64)
hk = { version = "latest", os = ["linux", "macos/arm64"] }

# Only install on Linux x86_64
jq = { version = "latest", os = ["linux/x64"] }
```

Supported architecture identifiers:

- `"arm64"` (or `"aarch64"`)
- `"x64"` (or `"x86_64"` or `"amd64"`)

When an entry contains `/`, both the OS and architecture must match. When an entry is just an OS name, it matches any architecture on that OS.

If a tool specifies an `os` restriction and the current operating system is not in the list, mise skips installing and using that tool.

## Tool Dependencies [​](#tool-dependencies)

You can declare explicit installation dependencies between tools using the `depends` field. This ensures that one tool is fully installed before another begins installing.

toml

```
[tools]
python = "3.14"
uv = "latest"
"pipx:ruff" = { version = "latest", depends = ["python"] }
```

In this example, `pipx:ruff` waits for `python` to finish installing before it starts.

The `depends` field accepts either a single string or an array of strings:

toml

```
[tools]
# Single dependency
"pipx:ruff" = { version = "latest", depends = "python" }

# Multiple dependencies
# "pipx:ruff" = { version = "latest", depends = ["python", "uv"] }
```

User-specified `[tools].depends` adds ordering constraints and makes matching tools available to install hooks. Backend declarations such as vfox `PLUGIN.depends` are combined with these user declarations in the same install dependency context.

Dependency declarations do not add tools to the configuration or install them automatically. When a matching tool is configured, its selected version must resolve and already be installed (or finish successfully earlier in the same install batch). A declaration with no matching configured tool may still be satisfied by an executable on the existing system or configuration `PATH`.

### vfox plugin hook dependencies [​](#vfox-plugin-hook-dependencies)

vfox plugin authors should declare requirements intrinsic to the plugin on the `PLUGIN` table in `metadata.lua`:

lua

```
PLUGIN = {
    name = "example",
    version = "1.0.0",
    depends = { "go" },
}
```

Use tool names as they would appear in `mise.toml`. Users can supplement plugin declarations with `[tools].depends`; both forms affect install ordering, the `PATH` visible to `os.execute` and `cmd.exec`, and `tools = true` environment values. They do not affect `io.popen`. See [Tool plugin development](https://mise.jdx.dev/tool-plugin-development.html#_2-metadata-lua).

## Caching and Performance [​](#caching-and-performance)

Remote version lists are cached according to [`fetch_remote_versions_cache`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#fetch_remote_versions_cache). Downloaded artifacts and backend metadata have their own caches. Retention and reuse depend on the backend and settings; a cached version list does not mean the requested tool is already installed.

Shell activation prepares the tool paths before commands run. `mise hook-env` can skip work when tracked configuration and environment inputs are unchanged. For slow prompts, use the [troubleshooting guide](https://mise.jdx.dev/troubleshooting.html#slow-shell-prompts) to find the expensive input. See [shims](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/shims.html) for the difference between resolving at the prompt and resolving each command.

## Common commands [​](#common-commands)

Here are some of the most important commands for working with dev tools. Click a command's header to open its reference page, which lists all available flags/options and more examples.

### [`mise use`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/use.html) [​](#mise-use)

`mise use` installs a requested version and records the request in configuration:

sh

```
mise use node@24
mise exec -- node --version
```

By default, it writes to the current project's `mise.toml`:

mise.toml

toml

```
[tools]
node = "24"
```

Use `--pin` to write a concrete version instead of the request, `--global` to set a personal default, or `--path` to choose a configuration file. See [write-target rules](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration.html#target-file-for-write-operations).

The command does not directly change its parent shell. Shell activation applies the selection at the next prompt or supported directory-change hook; `mise exec` and tasks load it explicitly. Editing `mise.toml` also changes the selection; run `mise install` afterward to install newly declared tools.

### [`mise install`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/install.html) [​](#mise-install)

`mise install` downloads or builds tools without changing version declarations. To select an installed version, declare it in configuration or pass it directly to `mise exec`, for example `mise exec node@24 -- node --version`.

TIP

If you're coming from `asdf`, there is no need to run `mise plugin add` first to install the plugin; that happens automatically if needed. You can still install plugins manually if you wish, or if you want to use a plugin that isn't in the default registry.

It can be used in many ways:

- `mise install node@20.0.0` - install a specific version
- `mise install node@20` - install the latest version matching this prefix
- `mise install node` - install whatever version of node is currently specified in `mise.toml` (or other config files)
- `mise install` - install all plugins and tools specified in the config files
- `mise install --include-task-tools` - also install every tool required by tasks in the current scope without running those tasks

The last form is useful for warming CI, container, or offline caches before running any task. Add `--monorepo` to include task tools from every configured monorepo root.

### [`mise exec`|`mise x`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/exec.html) [​](#mise-exec-mise-x)

Use `mise x` for one-off commands with specific tools. For example, to run a script with Python 3.14:

sh

```
mise x python@3.14 -- python myscript.py
```

With the default [`auto_install`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#auto_install) and [`exec_auto_install`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#exec_auto_install) settings, Python is installed if it isn't already. `mise x` also reads local/global `mise.toml`/`.tool-versions` files, so if you don't want to use `mise activate` or shims, you can use mise by prefixing commands with `mise x --`:

sh

```
mise x -- node --version
```

TIP

If you use this a lot, an alias can be helpful:

sh

```
alias mx="mise x --"
```

Similarly, `mise run` [executes tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/) and also activates the mise environment with all of your tools.

## System installations [​](#system-installations)

Use [`mise install --system`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/install.html#flags) to install tools in a shared system directory. For example, run this as your normal user:

sh

```
mise install --system uv
```

The default destination on Unix is `/usr/local/share/mise/installs`. Set `MISE_SYSTEM_DATA_DIR` to use a different system data directory, or [`system_installs_dir`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#system_installs_dir) to change only the installation directory. Installing a tool does not select it for use; declare its version in configuration or pass it to `mise exec`.

On Unix, mise downloads, verifies, and unpacks supported tools as your user, then invokes `sudo` to place the prepared installation in the system directory. Cache and project lockfile updates also run as your user. Updates to system shims and version symlinks use sudo when needed. If you already have write access to the destination, mise installs directly without sudo.

### Supported tools [​](#supported-tools)

Automatic elevation supports the `aqua`, `github`, `gitlab`, `forgejo`, `http`, and `s3` backends. The tool must work after being moved from a temporary directory to its final location and must not have a tool-level `postinstall` hook. Symlinks within the installation are preserved, but links pointing outside it are rejected.

Other backends, tools with `postinstall` hooks, and tools that embed their installation path (such as Python virtual environments) need a directory you can write to when installing as a normal user. These restrictions do not apply when mise installs directly into a writable directory.

### Permissions and sudo [​](#permissions-and-sudo)

- Interactive installations can prompt for your sudo password in the terminal. Noninteractive installations require sudo to work without a password prompt.
- Set [`system_packages.sudo`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#system_packages.sudo) to `false` to disable automatic elevation. Installations that need sudo then fail; installations into writable directories still work.
- For elevated installations, the destination and its existing ancestors must be owned by root and must not be writable by other users. Root-owned sticky directories, such as `/tmp`, are allowed.
- Use `mise install --system --force uv` to replace an installed version. mise prepares the replacement before changing the existing installation.
- The elevated helper only writes inside the system installs and shims directories as root sees them. It runs without configuration files, so a custom location must reach root through the environment, for example by keeping `MISE_SYSTEM_DATA_DIR` (or `MISE_SYSTEM_INSTALLS_DIR` and `MISE_SYSTEM_SHIMS_DIR`) in sudo's `env_keep`.

WARNING

`sudo mise install --system` still works, but runs the entire installation as root and warns that it can leave root-owned files in your home directory. Prefer running mise as your normal user and letting it invoke sudo when needed. Running mise directly as root, for example in a container, remains supported.

## Auto-Install Mechanisms [​](#auto-install-mechanisms)

mise provides several mechanisms to automatically install missing tools or versions as needed. Below, these are grouped by how and when they are triggered, with relevant settings for each. The general mechanisms below require [auto\_install](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#auto_install), with separate controls for execution, tasks, and missing commands. See [lazy tools](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/shims.html#lazy-tools) for explicit declarations that defer installation until a command is first used.

### On-Demand Execution ([`mise x`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/exec.html), [`mise r`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/run.html)) [​](#on-demand-execution-mise-x-mise-r)

By default, [`mise x`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/exec.html) and [`mise r`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/run.html) install missing non-lazy tools before execution. Lazy tools are handled on first use.

- **When it triggers:** Whenever you use [`mise x`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/exec.html) or [`mise r`](https://mise.jdx.dev/cli/run.html) with a tool/version that is not yet installed.
- **How to control:**
  - Setting: [`exec_auto_install`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#exec_auto_install) (default: true)
  - Setting: [`task.run_auto_install`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#task.run_auto_install) (default: true)

### Command Not Found Handler (Shell Integration) [​](#command-not-found-handler-shell-integration)

If you type a command in your shell (e.g., `node`) and it is not found, mise can attempt to auto-install the missing tool version if it knows which tool provides that binary.

- **When it triggers:** When a command is not found in the shell and the handler is enabled.
- **How to control:**
  - Setting: [`not_found_auto_install`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#not_found_auto_install) (default: true)
- **Limitation:** mise identifies the provider from the registry's bin metadata, so this covers configured tools even if they have never been installed — but not tools configured by a raw backend spec (e.g. `cargo:some-crate`), which carry no such metadata. Install those explicitly with `mise install`, or `mise x` to install and run in one step. See [troubleshooting](https://mise.jdx.dev/troubleshooting.html#auto-install-on-command-not-found-does-not-trigger).

TIP

Disable auto\_install for specific tools by setting [`auto_install_disable_tools`](https://mise.jdx.dev/configuration/settings.html#auto_install_disable_tools) to a list of tool names.
