Comparison to asdf

Comparison to asdf [​](#comparison-to-asdf)

mise reads `.tool-versions` and supports [legacy asdf plugins](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/asdf.html). You can start with an existing project's version declarations, then adopt `mise.toml` for [environment variables](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/) and [tasks](https://mise.jdx.dev/tasks/). CLI and plugin compatibility are best-effort; mise has its own commands, installation directories, and backend selection.

## Migrate from asdf to mise [​](#migrate-from-asdf-to-mise)

Start in one project before changing your shell defaults:

1. [Install mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html).
2. From the project directory, run `mise config ls` and `mise ls --current` to inspect how mise reads the existing `.tool-versions`.
3. Run `mise install`, then verify a project command through mise:sh

   ```
   mise exec -- node --version
   ```

   Replace `node --version` with a command from your project's tools. mise uses its own installations; it does not automatically reuse asdf's install directory.
4. Once the project works, remove asdf activation and shim `PATH` entries from your shell startup files and [activate mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#activate-mise). Start a new shell and check `mise doctor` and `command -v node`.

Keep shared `.tool-versions` files if teammates still use asdf. To update one with mise, specify the file and pin a concrete version:

sh

```
mise use --path .tool-versions --pin node@24
```

Avoid mise-specific prefixes or backend identifiers in a file that asdf must read. A `mise.toml` in the same directory takes precedence for tools it declares, so check for conflicting declarations before keeping both files.

For personal defaults, use `mise use -g node@24` or edit `~/.config/mise/config.toml`. Inspect `mise config ls` from outside a project to see which home/global files are contributing to your environment. Copy the versions you need explicitly instead of moving or rewriting your asdf installation.

## asdf in go (0.16+) [​](#asdf-in-go-0-16)

asdf 0.16 replaced the older Bash implementation with Go and changed parts of its CLI. In particular, current asdf uses `asdf set` to write versions. See [asdf's version commands](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/versions.html). `mise set` has a different purpose: it writes environment variables. Use `mise use` for tool versions.

## UX [​](#ux)

`mise use` combines installation and configuration. For example:

sh

```
mise use node@24 python@3.14
mise exec -- node --version
```

This records version requests for both tools and installs them if necessary. After cloning a configured project, `mise install` installs its tools without changing the declarations. You usually do not need to install plugins separately: the registry selects a backend, and many tools use built-in backends.

## Command Compatibility [​](#command-compatibility)

Prefer mise's documented command syntax in scripts. Some legacy asdf spellings are accepted, but compatibility aliases are not a complete emulation of asdf.

| Goal | asdf command | mise command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Install a specific version | `asdf install nodejs 24.0.0` | `mise install node@24.0.0` |
| Select a project version | `asdf set nodejs 24.0.0` | `mise use node@24.0.0` (also installs) |
| Select a personal default | `asdf set -u nodejs 24.0.0` | `mise use -g node@24.0.0` |
| List available versions | `asdf list all nodejs` | `mise ls-remote node` |
| Inspect selected versions | `asdf current` | `mise ls --current` |
| Find the selected executable | `asdf which node` | `mise which node` |
| Rebuild shims | `asdf reshim` | `mise reshim` |

mise recognizes the legacy tool names `nodejs` and `golang`, while its TOML configuration uses the canonical names `node` and `go`.

## Performance [​](#performance)

The main difference is when version selection runs. With normal `mise activate`, mise updates `PATH` and environment variables at the shell prompt or supported directory-change hooks. Subsequent tool calls use those executable paths directly. asdf resolves a tool through a shim when it is called.

mise also provides shims for programs that need stable executable paths. Their cost depends on how often commands pass through mise; use `mise exec -- <script>` to prepare the environment once for a script and its child processes. Historical benchmarks of Bash-based asdf do not describe current asdf performance. See [shims](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/shims.html) for the behavioral tradeoffs.

## Windows support [​](#windows-support)

mise supports native Windows for compatible tools and backends. Availability still depends on the tool's release artifacts and installation logic. Legacy asdf shell plugins generally require a Unix environment; using mise does not make those plugins native Windows installers. See [Windows](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html#windows-scoop).

## Supply chain security [​](#supply-chain-security)

An asdf plugin executes shell code during tool management. When using one through either manager, you trust the plugin's maintainers in addition to the tool's publisher. mise can install many tools through built-in download backends without an external plugin.

## Security [​](#security)

Verification varies by distribution. For example, packslip verifies signed manifests, and aqua supports verification methods described by its registry entries. A tool or backend name alone is not a guarantee that a particular artifact has a signature. See the [security guide](https://mise.jdx.dev/security.html) for trust, verification, and configuration controls.

## Extra backends [​](#extra-backends)

Use the registry shorthand when available, or select a package source explicitly:

mise.toml

toml

```
[tools]
node = "24"
ripgrep = "latest"
"npm:prettier" = "3"
```

Here the npm backend needs Node.js, so both are declared. Other backends can install release binaries, Python CLIs, Rust crates, or private tools. See the [backend reference](https://mise.jdx.dev/dev-tools/backends/) for prerequisites and options.
