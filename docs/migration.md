## <a id="manual-migration"></a>Manual Migration from Visual Studio Code to VSCodium

VSCodium (and a freshly cloned copy of vscode built from source) stores its extension files in `~/.vscode-oss`. So if you currently have Visual Studio Code installed, your extensions won't automatically populate. You can copy the `extensions` from `~/.vscode/extensions` to `~/.vscode-oss/extensions`.

Visual Studio Code stores its `keybindings.json` and `settings.json` file in these locations:

- __Windows__: `%APPDATA%\Code\User`
- __macOS__: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User`
- __Linux__: `$HOME/.config/Code/User`

You can copy these files to the VSCodium user settings folder:

- __Windows__: `%APPDATA%\VSCodium\User`
- __macOS__: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/VSCodium/User`
- __Linux__: `$HOME/.config/VSCodium/User`

To copy your settings manually:

- In Visual Studio Code, go to Settings (`Cmd+,` on macOS, `Ctrl+,` on Windows/Linux).
- Click the three dots `...` and choose 'Open settings.json'.
- Copy the contents of settings.json into the same place in VSCodium.

Note: When manually copying extensions, be aware that not all extensions from Visual Studio Code are compatible with VSCodium, especially proprietary ones. Refer to the [Extensions compatibility](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/blob/master/docs/extensions-compatibility.md) page for more details.

## <a id="semi-automatic-migration"></a>Semi-Automatic Migration with "Sync Settings" Extension

The [**Sync Settings**](https://github.com/zokugun/vscode-sync-settings) extension can simplify the migration process by enabling synchronization of settings, keybindings, extensions, and more between Visual Studio Code and VSCodium. Its author is the main maintainer of VSCodium ;)

The extension is available in the Visual Studio Marketplace, OpenVSX or directly in its GitHub repository.

Note: While this extension will attempt to sync your extensions, remember that some Visual Studio Code extensions, particularly proprietary ones, may not be compatible with VSCodium. Check the [Extensions compatibility](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/blob/master/docs/extensions-compatibility.md) page for more information after syncing.

### Steps:

1. Install the **Sync Settings** extension in both Visual Studio Code and VSCodium.
2. Configure the extension on both Visual Studio Code and VSCodium:
  - Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux).
  - Search for `Sync Settings: Open the repository settings` and execute the command.
  - Configure the repository
3. Export your current settings from Visual Studio Code:
  - Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux).
  - Search for `Sync Settings: Upload (user -> repository)` and execute the command.
4. Import the settings into VSCodium:
  - I recommend the setting `"syncSettings.openOutputOnActivity": true,`.
  - Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux).
  - Search for `Sync Settings: Download (repository -> user)` and execute the command.
  - Wait for all the extensions to be downloaded and installed (follow logs in the `Output` panel) before restarting VSCodium.

This method ensures that all supported configurations are seamlessly transferred.
