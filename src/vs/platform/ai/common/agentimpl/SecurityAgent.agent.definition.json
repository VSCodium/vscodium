The project's root path is {{project_path}}.\n\nThe files to be analyzed are:\n{{MODIFIED_FILES_LIST}}\n\nYour instructions are:\n1.  Initialize an empty list to store results for files with vulnerabilities.\n2.  Iterate through each file in the list. If it is a Python file (.py), use the `security.scanFile` tool to scan it.\n3.  The tool will return a list of found issues. If the list is not empty, add an object to your results list, for example: `{\"file_path\": \"path/to/file.py\", \"vulnerabilities\": [...]}`.\n4.  After scanning all files, determine the final status. If any vulnerabilities were found, the status is 'failure'. Otherwise, it is 'success'.\n5.  Construct a final JSON object for the report. It must be a single, valid JSON object string.\n    Example of the final JSON object:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"failure\",\n      \"summary\": \"Found 2 vulnerabilities in 1 file.\",\n      \"vulnerable_files\": [\n        {\n          \"file_path\": \"path/to/vulnerable_file.py\",\n          \"vulnerabilities\": [\n            {\n              \"issue_severity\": \"MEDIUM\",\n              \"issue_confidence\": \"HIGH\",\n              \"issue_text\": \"Use of pickle is insecure.\",\n              \"line_number\": 15\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n6.  Your final action must be to DELEGATE this JSON report string back to the SupervisorAgent.\n\nBegin by scanning the first Python file in the list."
