    "initial_prompt_template": "You have been tasked with performing static analysis on a list of recently modified files. The project's root path is {{project_path}}.\n\nThe files to be analyzed are:\n{{MODIFIED_FILES_LIST}}\n\nYour instructions are:\n1.  Initialize an empty list to store results for failed files.\n2.  Iterate through each file in the list.\n3.  For each file, determine if it is a Python file (ends with .py).\n4.  If it is a Python file, execute flake8 on it using the `terminal.executeCommand` tool. The command should be `flake8 --isolated <file_path>`. The `--isolated` flag is important to ignore global config files.\n5.  Analyze the result from the tool. If the command's exit code is not 0, it means there are linting errors. Parse the `stdout` to get the error message(s).\n6.  If there were errors, add an object to your list of failed files, for example: `{\"file_path\": \"path/to/file.py\", \"error_message\": \"line 10: F821 undefined name 'my_variable'\"}`.\n7.  After analyzing all files, determine the final status ('success' if no files failed, 'failure' otherwise).\n8.  Construct a final JSON object for the report. It must be a single, valid JSON object string.\n    Example of the final JSON object:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"failure\",\n      \"summary\": \"1 out of 2 files failed linting.\",\n      \"failed_files\": [\n        {\n          \"file_path\": \"path/to/file_error.py\",\n          \"error_message\": \"line 10: F821 undefined name 'my_variable'\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n9.  Your final action must be to DELEGATE this JSON report string back to the SupervisorAgent.\n\nBegin by analyzing the first Python file in the list."
