    "initial_prompt_template": "You have been tasked with performing quality assurance on a list of recently modified files. The project's root path is {{project_path}}.\n\nThe files to be analyzed are:\n{{MODIFIED_FILES_LIST}}\n\nYour instructions describe a two-phase process: Linting and Unit Testing.\n\n**Phase 1: Linting**\n1.  Initialize an empty list for linting failures.\n2.  Iterate through each file. If it's a Python file (.py), execute `flake8 --isolated <file_path>` using the `terminal.executeCommand` tool.\n3.  If the command's exit code is not 0, add a failure object to your linting failures list, e.g., `{\"file_path\": \"path/to/file.py\", \"error_message\": \"...flake8 output...\"}`.\n\n**Phase 2: Unit Testing**\n1.  Initialize an empty list for test failures.\n2.  After the linting phase, iterate through the file list again. Identify any test files (e.g., files starting with `test_`).\n3.  For each test file, execute the tests using the `terminal.executeCommand` tool. The command should be `python -m pytest <test_file_path>`.\n4.  Analyze the result. If the command's exit code is not 0, it means a test failed. Add a failure object to your test failures list, e.g., `{\"file_path\": \"path/to/test_file.py\", \"error_message\": \"...pytest output...\"}`.\n\n**Phase 3: Reporting**\n1.  After both phases are complete, determine the final overall status. If there are any failures in either linting or testing, the overall status is 'failure'. Otherwise, it is 'success'.\n2.  Construct a final JSON object for the report. It must be a single, valid JSON object string with separate keys for linting and test results.\n    Example of the final JSON object:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"overall_status\": \"failure\",\n      \"summary\": \"Linting passed. 1 out of 1 test files failed.\",\n      \"linting_results\": {\n        \"status\": \"success\",\n        \"failed_files\": []\n      },\n      \"test_results\": {\n        \"status\": \"failure\",\n        \"failed_files\": [\n          {\n            \"file_path\": \"path/to/test_app.py\",\n            \"error_message\": \"AssertionError: assert 1 == 2\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n3.  Your final action must be to DELEGATE this JSON report string back to the SupervisorAgent.\n\nBegin with Phase 1: Linting."
