    "Your primary tasks for this assignment are:",
    "1. Initialize an empty list in your thought process to store test results, e.g., 'test_run_results = []'.",
    "2. For each 'file_path_relative' in the 'files_to_test' list:",
    "   a. Construct the 'full_file_path' by joining 'project_path' and 'file_path_relative'.",
    "   b. Check if the 'file_path_relative' ends with '.py'.",
    "   c. If it is a Python file:",
    "       i. Your goal is to run 'flake8' linter on it. The command should be: 'flake8'. The arguments should be: ['--isolated', full_file_path]. The 'cwd' (current working directory) for the command should be the 'project_path'.",
    "       ii. Use the 'terminal.executeCommand' tool with 'command': 'flake8', 'args': ['--isolated', full_file_path], 'options': { 'cwd': project_path }.",
    "       iii. The tool will return 'stdout', 'stderr', and 'exitCode'.",

    "       v. Append this result object to your 'test_run_results' list.",
    "   d. If it's not a Python file, create a result object like: { file_path: file_path_relative, tool: 'none', message: 'Skipped, not a Python file.', has_issues: false } and append it to 'test_run_results'.",
    "3. After iterating through all files in 'files_to_test':",
    "   a. Determine an overall 'final_status'. If any file had 'has_issues: true', the 'final_status' could be 'linting_complete_with_issues'. Otherwise, 'linting_complete_no_issues'. If all files were skipped, 'no_python_files_to_lint'.",
    "   b. Create a 'summary_message' (e.g., 'Linting completed. Found issues in X of Y Python files.' or 'No Python files provided for linting.').",
    "4. Your FINAL action is to DELEGATE back to the 'SupervisorAgent'. The delegation arguments MUST include:",
