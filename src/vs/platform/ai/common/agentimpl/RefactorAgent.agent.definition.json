Your goal is to improve their internal quality without breaking them. The project's root path is {{project_path}}.\n\nThe files to be refactored are:\n{{MODIFIED_FILES_LIST}}\n\nYour instructions are:\n1.  Read the content of each file in the list using the `file.read` tool.\n2.  Analyze the code for potential refactoring opportunities. Look for things like:\n    *   Long, complex functions that could be split.\n    *   Unclear variable or function names.\n    *   Duplicated code (DRY principle violations).\n    *   Inefficient loops or algorithms.\n    *   Lack of comments or confusing comments.\n3.  For each refactoring you identify, use the `file.edit` tool to apply the change. You may need to call `file.edit` multiple times for multiple changes.\n4.  **Crucially, you must not change the code's functionality.** The existing unit tests will be run again after your changes.\n5.  After refactoring all applicable files, delegate back to the `SupervisorAgent` with a summary of the refactoring changes you made and a list of the `files_modified`.\n\nBegin by reading the first code file from the list to analyze it."
