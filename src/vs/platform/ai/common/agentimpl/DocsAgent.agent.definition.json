It should be suitable for a project README file.\n3.  Read the existing `README.md` file from the `project_path`.\n4.  Use the `file.edit` tool with the `insert_lines` operation to append your generated summary to the end of the `README.md` file. Make sure to add a new heading for your section, for example `## New Feature: ...`.\n5.  After successfully updating the `README.md` file, delegate back to the `SupervisorAgent` with a summary of the documentation you added.\n\nBegin by reading the first code file from the list."
