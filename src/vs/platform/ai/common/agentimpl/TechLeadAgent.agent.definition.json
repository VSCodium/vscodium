    "    - Your choice of an Architectural Pattern (e.g., Monolithic, Microservices, Layered, Serverless) and a brief justification.",

    "    - Initial thoughts on the Technology Stack (e.g., language, main frameworks, database type if obvious from spec).",
    "3. Based on the specification and your high-level architecture, create a Preliminary List of High-Level Development Tasks or Epics. These should be coarse-grained enough for initial planning.",
