                // THIS IS THE CRITICAL POINT FOR UI INTEGRATION.
                // In a real system, this `execute` method would not return directly.
                // It would trigger an event or call a service method that the UI listens to.
                // The UI would then display the prompt and capture input.
                // Once the user submits input via the UI, the UI would call back into the
                // AgentRunnerService (or a related service) with the input.
                // That service would then "resolve" this tool's execution, allowing the
                // agent's ReAct cycle to continue with the user's input as the observation.

                // For now, to make this runnable in a conceptual test without full UI plumbing,
                // we can simulate this by:
                // 1. Logging that we are waiting.
                // 2. Returning a predefined value or throwing a specific "WaitingForUserInputError"
                //    that the AgentRunnerService would catch and handle by pausing.
                //
                // For this iteration, we'll make it so the AgentRunnerService itself needs to
                // specially handle this tool name and manage the async wait.
                // This tool's execute function, when called by a naive runner, would thus represent
                // the point *after* the user has already provided input.
                //
                // The actual "pausing" and "resuming" logic will be primarily in AgentRunnerService.
                // So, this tool's execute function conceptually returns the input *after* it has been received.

                // If AgentRunnerService is designed to handle the async wait *outside* this execute method:
                // This execute method might not even be fully called in the typical sense until input is ready.
                // Or, it's called, and it signals "I need input", and AgentRunnerService makes it happen.

                // Let's assume AgentRunnerService will recognize "user.requestInput" and handle the pause.
                // When AgentRunnerService "resumes" this tool call (after getting actual user input),
                // it would effectively provide that input here.
                // So, this function will just return a placeholder for now, as the real value
                // will be supplied by the AgentRunnerService when it processes this specific tool.

                // This is a placeholder. The AgentRunnerService will need to implement the actual
                // mechanism to pause and get input, then feed it as the result of this tool.
                console.warn(`[UserRequestInputTool] Conceptual execution: This tool signals the need for user input. The AgentRunnerService must handle the actual pause and resume with user's text.`);

                // This return is what the agent would see *after* the input is provided.
                // The AgentRunnerService will have to "inject" the real userInput here.
                // For testing without full AgentRunnerService changes yet, this might be problematic.
                // Let's return a structure that AgentRunnerService can fill.
                // For now, the actual value of `userInput` would be determined by how `AgentRunnerService`
                // is modified to handle this tool. If it's not modified, this will just return "SIMULATED_USER_INPUT".
